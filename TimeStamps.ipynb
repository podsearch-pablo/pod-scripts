      "{1: {'Who is Dream?': \" There's three reasons why Dream is so successful, and the first is that he's a purple cow. But we're gonna get into that later. If you don't know who Dream is, over the past three years, he became one of the most famous people on the internet. How do Dream? Dream is here! Oh my god, it's Dream! But no one knew what he looked like, not even his closest friends. I have never seen his face before. No joke. So when Dream actually took off his mask and revealed his face, that took over the internet, and over 38 million people have actually watched that video of him taking off his mask. We're gonna be breaking down the three tactics that Dream used to explode on YouTube. And whether or not you're a Minecraft streamer or you're even familiar with him, these tactics can be super helpful for you as a creative. Also, according to YouTube statistics, only a small percentage of people that watch our videos are actually subscribed. So if you end up enjoying this video, consider subscribing. It's free, and you can always unsubscribe. Alright, so this is a text that I got last week from my sister-in-law, Lauren. She said, I don't understand Dream. This week, you'll have to explain it to me, I'm so old. That's probably a sentiment a lot of people had when Dream completely took over the internet with his face reveal. So who is Dream? So Dream, if you're unfamiliar with him, he's a Minecraft streamer, he streams himself playing Minecraft on his YouTube channel, and he quickly stuck out from the rest of the streamers who were playing Minecraft. Because it is a very large community. Now, yeah, Minecraft is one of the most popular games, and if not the most popular game in the world, and Minecraft videos are an incredibly popular genre of YouTube video. So it's almost a question of, well, if you're going to make Minecraft videos, what's the difference? And Dream actually did something really different. Yeah, so he is a developer and a coder, and he was able to create situations in worlds within Minecraft that no one had ever seen before. So Minecraft, but gravity flips upside down every minute. And that's actually the first tactic that we recognize that Dream used to build this massive audience. And that tactic is to be a purple cow.\", 'Why Dream is a Purple Cow': \" Excuse me? That might sound strange. Should we have Seth explain it to them? Yeah. So Seth Goedin, who's a marketer and a writer, has this concept of the purple cow and is a marketing concept, but it really applies to what Dream did to grow on YouTube. Consumers don't care about you at all. They just don't care. Part of the reason is they got way more choices than they used to and way less time. And in a world where we have too many choices and too little time, the obvious thing to do is just ignore stuff. And my parable here is you're driving down the road and you see a cow and you keep driving. Because you've seen cows before. Cows are invisible. Cows are boring. Who's going to stop and pull over and say, oh, look, a cow. Nobody. The cow was purple. You notice it. The thing that's going to decide what gets talked about, what gets done, what gets changed, what gets purchased, what gets built, is it remarkable? And remarkable is a really cool word. Because we think it just means neat. But it also means worth making a remark about. And I think no matter what type of crater you are right now, most likely you're facing a lot of competition. And it's really hard to stand out, but that's actually what you should prioritize. How can you be not necessarily better but different? I mean, you can see by the quality of this TED Talk that this concept from Seth Godin is old. It's timeless. The concept of being remarkable, the concept of standing out, the concept that consumers don't have a lot of time, that is a concept that existed pre-youtube. And what Dream really did was say, okay, if there's this many Minecraft videos, you know, Minecraft, but gravity is flipped every minute, all of a sudden that's the purple cow. This video, we coded it, so that at random times, the gravity flips upside down. Our goal is to beat the game. These are things that other Minecraft streamers couldn't necessarily do because they weren't coders. Not only are you gonna click on that and watch it, but he's actually giving you the sentence that you can go say to another friend. So, hey, did you see that video where lava is falling from the sky? So, I think you have to, as a creator, think about the remark that someone is going to make about your video because at the end of the day, the way ideas spread, the way that video spread, is actually through word of mouth. When we interviewed Mr. Beast, what was remarkable about it was that it was the only interview with Mr. Beast for the most part. Now, he went on a podcast tour, there's a lot. So, you have to try and find that area where you can stand out. You look at Andrew Schultz, their episode. It was four hours long. That's remarkable. Have you seen the episode with Mr. Beast that's four hours long? It's true. So, there's always ways to sort of iterate and maintain that purple cow essence. So, be a purple cow. Yeah. By the way, Colin, we got this package from Dream. Mm-hmm. We bought the package. I don't want to make it sound like he sent it to us. We purchased it. Just a wake-cooler when he was. Yeah. Okay, I'll go back to that. We got this package from Dream. And we don't know what's inside of this, but we are going to open it at the end of this episode. Thanks, Dream. So, the other thing that makes him remarkable is the fact that he's faceless. I mean, that's obvious, right? Your favorite streamers, your favorite gamers, you had some sense of what they looked like, you could develop relationships with them, could develop emotions and attach them to this face. But Dream being faceless was another one of those things where it's like, he's a Minecraft creator and he doesn't have a face. Or he's got a blob as a face, smiley blob. I think what's really interesting about Dream is that it was accidental. It was not deliberately written into his plan that he would be faceless. He really says it's a product of the pandemic. That's just when he started to take off was 2020. And everyone already was wearing masks. And if you're a Minecraft streamer, you don't have to show your face. And it just started to become a thing. He didn't choose his face as his avatar. He chose this logo. And then started to realize, oh wait, this is adding a layer of intrigue for my audience.\", 'Why Dream is a Mystery Box': \" And the fact that Dream was faceless for so long is tactic number two, which is have a mystery box. That probably makes no sense right now, but we are gonna play this clip from director JJ Abrams that we'll explain it. Tannen's mystery magic box. I bought this decades ago and I'm not kidding. If you look at this, you'll see it's never been opened. Now I was looking at this was in my office and as it always is on the shelf and I was thinking, why have I not opened this? And I realized that I haven't opened it because it represents something important. Infinite possibility. It represents hope. It represents potential. The withholding and information, doing that intentionally, is much more engaging. Whether it's like the shark and jaws. If Spielberg's mechanical shark bruise had worked, it would not have been remotely as scary. He would have seen it too much. In Alien, they never really show the Alien terrifying. Even in a movie like The Graduate. They're having that date, remember, they're in the car and it's loud and so they put the top up. You don't hear anything they're saying. You can't hear a word, but it's the most romantic date ever and you love it because you don't hear it. I love the premise that the shark and jaws is scarier because you never see the shark. And when you say it's scarier, it's actually that the audience has interpreted it to be scarier. It implies a level of work that the audience has to do to enjoy the story. And that's kind of what Dream did. There was all this mystique and conversation around who is he? Not knowing what Dream looked like created this mystery box for the entire audience that they got to fill in themselves and they got to interpret who Dream was and almost even place their own experience into this person. And that's all of a sudden developing a deeper relationship because your mind is connecting the dots. Another really great example in the office. Yes. And Ham takes off her mic to go hug Michael on Michael's last episode. I mean, the fact that you can't hear their last conversation makes it that much better. It becomes as powerful as you want that moment to be. Not as powerful as maybe the writers were going to write it. I also think that as the face reveal started to get closer and closer, he facetimed creators. And he had them film their own reactions where they're looking at their phone and then he calls them, they're reaction to seeing his face for the first time. So all of a sudden, you have this unclosed loop, right? Which is what does this guy look like? You don't know. And your curiosity is killing you for two years plus. And then as the moment's getting closer and closer, he's closing that loop, but not all the way to build the anticipation. And the mystery box is slowly opening, right? So you're peaking in a little bit to other people's reactions to seeing what's in the mystery box. That's such good marketing. Yeah, and I think as a creator, what you should be thinking about is how can you use omission as a storytelling tool? Right. How can you sometimes not give the audience everything? Like this. We don't know what's in this bag, right? But it came directly from Dream himself. That's right. And if someone was here right now, they opened it, looked at it, and had a reaction, that actually makes it even more interesting.\", 'Why Dream took off his mask': \" So now I think it's interesting to think about the fact that by omitting his face, that was what brought him a lot of success. Now he decides to reveal his true identity. Was that the right move, right? You know, there's a couple of reasons that he states why he did this. Number one, he mentioned he felt like there wasn't much else he could do in Minecraft. Like he had already kind of done everything that he could do. Let alone the Dream SMP, which we have not even touched on. Right. It wasn't that he was just making unique situations. He also had a server that became a world for live storytelling, again, something that was unique to Minecraft at the time. Listen. And then created all of these characters that became incredibly famous. I'm just saying, I do SMP is this entire other thing. I agree that I can't believe we haven't even mentioned this far in the episode. I'm just going to ask that someone in the comments explains the Dream SMP to everyone else, because it will take us too long to try and explain it. We'll pin the best explanation of the Dream SMP. Ben, you know, there's someone watching going, the Dream SMP, yeah, the whole time. The SMP. Yeah, screaming. Yeah, screaming. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the other thing that he mentions about why he revealed his face is actually one of the most human things you could want, which is just that,\", 'A new way to make money as a creator': \" so this episode is sponsored by Jelly Smack.

All right, back to the episode.\", 'The real reason Dream took off his mask': \" So the other thing that he mentions about why he revealed his face is actually one of the most human things you could want, which is just that he wanted to hang out with his friends. Just get out in the world, be an actual creator, be a person, say hi to my friends finally. And that really is tactic number three, build a bridge. And what that means is like your digital world should be a bridge to your physical world. Dream talks about the concept that he's going to do IRL videos and this concept of IRL, meaning In Real Life, is actually explored in this TED Talk by Jordan Frith. There's probably no phrase that annoys me more than In Real Life. For one thing, as someone who got in many disagreements with my ex girlfriend over Facebook Messenger, I'm going to show you that was very real. It wasn't less real because it happened online. It had real consequences in the physical world. Anyone who's been cyber bullied, the fact that it happens on Facebook doesn't make it any better, it's still real life. It affects a physical body. His concept here is that the term IRL in Real Life suggests that there's two separate worlds, the digital world and the real life world. But actually that's not true. We actually exist in a hybrid space, as he calls it. So with Dream, primarily existing in cyberspace or in the digital world. Cyberspace. Yes, cyberspace, that's a 90s term, existing in cyberspace or the digital world, it's actually impossible. There's no world where he can just exist there because these worlds coexist. It was affecting his physical life by not revealing his face. Yeah. I read in articles somewhere that he was traveling from Florida to Georgia to go to the dentist so that no one would recognize him. That's because people knew he was from Orlando. But how would people recognize him? I don't understand that. By his voice. Uh, should have altered his voice. Come on, dream. But that's pretty aggressive. I think also read that he would go to Georgia to go to dinner with his mom sometimes. Like if you feel that restricted, like you can't go out to a restaurant in your own hometown, that's clearly this point where your online life is affecting your physical life. They are actually one in the same. They have implications. So I think that, you know, the lesson for creators here is that, no matter what, whatever you're building digitally from a community perspective, from a brand perspective, you should be thinking about how that interacts with the physical world because they're not two separate things. What did Dream lose by revealing his face? And what did he gain?\", 'Pros and Cons of unmasking': \" Let's talk about that. I think there's something really interesting that he lost, which is like we said with omitting his face, people got to fill in the gaps with who he was. He could be the ultimate superhero across race, socioeconomic levels, like he could be whatever you wanted him to be. And it's at no fault to him or anything. But once he revealed who he is, you lose some of the mystique and he no longer gets to be the superhero necessarily. He's clay a 23 year old from Orlando. Hi, my name is Clay, otherwise known as Dream Online. I think the interesting thing is like, he's going to create a new channel where he's going to do IRL experiences as clay. So kind of what has happened is there's two personas that are developing now. There is Dream and there's Clay. What he gained from, you know, a business perspective is also he can scale the premise and the concept and the brand of dream while building the brand of clay at the same time. Also think he's a creator of worlds more than he is a creator of videos. He's like Simon Cowell. Okay. No one's ever made that comparison. Simon Cowell is responsible for putting one direction together and then that became a world, right? And then some of them went off on their own. Dream essentially is responsible for the Dream SMP and you look at him on that panel at TwitchCon. He's all the way at the end and everyone on that panel is like a member of one direction. That's right. And at some point, Carole might be Harry Styles. I think Carl is Harry Styles. I think he kind of is Harry Styles. He grabs the mic for the first time everyone goes nuts. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I say all of this just to say that I think that actually may be what allows him to have longevity. The fact that his history is being a world builder, not just someone who follows trends and make videos. Like he builds environments for communities and creators to exist in all at once. Yeah, I think that's what Dream will continue to be. It's up for debate. Like who is Clay? Who is Clay going to become? Who knows? Now you guys have seen my face. Questions over. What does Dream look like? This is me unless I'm an actor. Might be an actor. Let's just open the package.\", \"Unboxing Dream's Mystery Package\": \" Let's open the package. What is in this package? Here we go. How do you, do I need something sharp? I would love some scissors. And now what is this a bracelet? God, the branding is so strong. Yeah, the green. It's so strong that it's like this brand. Marilyn, we got it open. You have a dart in your hand? When you have a dart coming. What if Marilyn just threw the dart in. She assassinated you in old school. Yeah. That would be a perfect out. So this is a bracelet from Dream. Marilyn, you bought this. How much does this cost and just explain this product to me? What is this? This is a Dream's USB bracelet. To buy the USB bracelet, we had to join the Dream Smile Club, which is an annual membership. We got the silver tier for $15.99 to get access to this member-only drop. And the bracelet itself costs $24.99. Would you say that was worth it? I think if you really care about him, it's worth it. Yeah. It is expensive. It's expensive. Oh, you know what this is? It's a snap bracelet. That's fun. That's so good. That brings me back. Oh, that's nice. Isn't that nice? Yeah, that's nice. So it's a bracelet, but it's also... What? Did I just break it? No. No. Okay. USB thumb drive. Yes. It has data on it. All right, cool. All right, let's see what's on this. There's a lot on this. Is it? Oh, my God. Baby photos? Childhood emails? Minecraft screenshots? Photos? 500 subscribers? That's cool. That's really cool. We've got time capsule. That was a photo of a dead rat. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Whoa, dude. So essentially, this is all just exclusive content. This would be like kind of similar to a Patreon, except his comes with a physical product. Right. Right. Like some people pay for a Patreon. Monthly, and you get exclusive photos behind the scenes, videos. That's essentially what this is, but he's just done in a different way that again is remarkable. Yeah. Wow. This is so interesting, because he's following the three rules that we just talked about. And then this product is remarkable. You have to talk about it. You know, it's exclusive content, but he did it through a physical piece that you order, that you get in the mail, that you have to plug into your computer, and that experience, right? So that's remarkable already. Also, he uses omission as a storytelling tool. It's a mystery box, because even as you plug this in, you don't know what's going to be on it. And then you have to explore yourself. It doesn't say start here or just watch this video. You're really navigating it on your own. And then he's recognizing that the digital world is a bridge to the physical world. Because again, this is a physical product. It's something that I now get to have in my room as a physical representation, or around my wrist as a physical representation of me being a part of this community. And I get to experience and have a physical experience while looking at these, right? This guy, DreamMan, he might become like the biggest marketer on the internet. He's very smart. He's damn good. Wow. Okay. Right here at the end of this video, you know more about Dream than when you started this video and you have a better understanding how he actually rose to his fame. And I can't wait to read your explanations of the DreamSMP. All right. Yeah.\"}, 2: {'The YouTube “Break” Button': \" I said this to Colin. I was like, we have ads booked to the end of the year. Does that suggest that no matter what will be inspired to make? It does. But what if two weeks from now, we're like, I actually don't want to make something. But we have a sponsor. Yeah. Right. So what do we do then? Right. Right. And so I think that's for us, this happened in a pretty short window of going from net income being negative, you know, 18,000 to having a team and having an office. And I think we're actually now just coming back down from that and being like, it's outside of just the social media met. There's also the business side of it where it's like, oh, holy shit, I'm making money from this for the first time. Yep. Like real money for the first time. And that I think, especially for me growing up how I did where the dinner table conversation is exclusively about money, basically, you know, like you live in this scarcity mindset where for the first time when there's money, you're like, I got to do anything and everything to keep collecting this. And I think that's something that I'm reflecting on now and recognizing like, that's when it feels uncomfortable to tie your artistry to that feeling of scarcity. Yep. Because now you're making decisions in a completely different, with a completely different lens. Yeah. And by the way, I'm not immune to that either. Like, I'll get a call, go do this game show. We'll give you a bag, go do this. You'll get a bag, go perform in this country. You'll get a bag. And all the OGs, the, the Jedi that I call, the first thing that lasts me is like, but why are you doing the gig? Do you need the money? If they go, if you need the money, then go do it. Go do what you got to do. There's no judgment there. You can go do the pizza commercial or the Samsung Galaxy 5, you know, Verizon 5G commercial. It's the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5 for Ryzen 5G. I don't know if you know this, but it's the fastest 5G that's out there right there in the country. You can stream game on the go. Now, you may, that's right. You may, that's exactly not need that bag. Yeah. Or you may need it and it may finance the, the special. Yeah. And that bag actually did help pay for that set. You know, and so everybody's doing that math. The thing that I'm always wary of, I just don't want to go down. I call it the YouTube med school route. For 10 years later or 12 years later, you look back and you're like, I don't even know why did I just do this. Yeah. So I hope and pray for myself and for everybody that, you know, you, you find that true path of what you want to really do. And you use the algorithm. You don't let it use you. So to speak. I think that's very good. But a lot of your special and a lot of stuff I've listened to you talk about. You talk about control. I was curious actually one of the, the most interesting things I wrote down when watching King's Jester was in the beginning of the show, as you're talking about your daughter, you, you build this narrative of like she can decide it or she won't have to go to Kumaan, right? And Kumaan is kind of the representation of a lack of control. And then you start to explore the first time you felt control was through constant, stand up. Yeah. I'm just curious about your relationship with control\", 'Control \\\\u0026 The Pressure of Pace': \" and how that's evolved. Stand up was something that gave me a sense of agency. And when you figure out a joke, it's like figuring out a puzzle. You know, you, you put these two things into the equation and then out pops a reaction, which is laugh, laughter, which is an involuntary reaction. You can't force somebody to laugh. And so when you get that laughter, I get the validation of knowing, oh, you, you see the world the same way I, the same way I do. There's this feeling of feeling seen through that. You also can take that thing and be out of control. And so it's kind of crazy. The first jokes that I told really did save my life. And when I was taking it too far, I lost control. Now it became way too out of control. And so one of the things that I've gotten as I've gotten older is I realize, especially now that I have a wife and kids, that circle of influence and control on the steering wheel. I have less of. It's wild. This is the first time in my life all my friends, they have parents that are getting sick, parents that are passing away. For the first time, I'm seeing friends getting divorces. So the early trajectory of my life was people gaining things, gaining new experiences, holding hands for the first time, kissing for the first time, falling in love for the first time, making dorm room friends for the first time, first girlfriend, first, whatever. And now I'm entering this new chapter where I'm like, oh, I'm starting to lose things. Friends are losing their hair, their waistline, spouses, loved ones. And I've just become humbled by it. I've also taken chin checks. I've had wins. I've had losses. I've had shows. I've gotten cancelled all that sort of stuff. And it just kind of humbles you and goes, all right, it's not up to me. I'm curious. How does the pace of your creation now play into that control? Because I think it's like five years since homecoming. Yeah. Right? And then to me, I would look at that gap. It's too big, maybe. Also without Patriot Act being on, right? Yeah. Putting a lot of pressure on King's Jester. Right. And for us, we get to put out a video every week. We give up some control, right? Because of that pace. Yeah. We also gain control, like make adjustments. And keep moving. But for you, what's the give and take? What you gain? I think it's part of the scale and the size of the idea. So if you want to do a movie and your budget is anywhere between five to 30 million dollars, just to get capital, get in pre-production, edit, shoot, mix, master, something. It's going to take you a year and a half to two years. Some movies take five years. That's even longer, sometimes 10, just to get everything in order. That's the trade-off. The upside cost is deep emotional resonance. So you can't compare its apples and oranges. It's the you can't compare top gun, Maverick to a podcast episode. They're different things. And it goes back to what we were talking about in the middle of the episode. And when I wrote down here, what do you want to do? And then you have to build a series of decisions around that. So for this feature that we're about to do for the culture with Amazon, that's going to be two years of our life. We got to go cast. We got to go get the music. I got to go fly to India, get a music director. I got to go do this. I got to go get a choreographer. All these things need to be done. It's going to be a two-year journey. And I have to have the confidence in belief in myself. That's the check every morning. I'm getting checked. Maybe I should do this other thing. I believe in this idea so much that I'm going to continue on this path and hope that it translates and resonates. Because it's more honest than me following the social pressure of going to YouTube dental school. I mean, real talk. Real talk. That's the thing. Just everybody else is doing this. But the why I want to do for the culture. Because I've never seen a movie like that before is bigger than the why of I should do a podcast because all my other friends are doing podcasts. Or celebrities are getting paid out to do podcasts. That's not a good why to me. Yeah. So that's that look. I'm going to ask you guys a question because I have to humble myself before the audience. It's not my choice. The people in the comments, the people that watch this stuff. I don't know. I don't know if the decision I made is the right decision. I don't know. I hope it resonates. I hope people find value. I hope people think the specialist special or they might be like, I don't think so. I have to humble myself to the audience too. That's I love just to go back to what you said earlier about like kind of the center of the bell curve. Because for me, watching homecoming king and watching kings jester. Like when I step away, those have profoundly impacted my perspective. And the difference that it's made me think about. When we walked out of seeing it live, for me, I felt like asking myself the question of like, have I made anything like that? Or am I thinking constantly about tomorrow's post? Right. And I think that as we're like, this is a very fresh, even though we've been making YouTube videos for 10 years, this is a very fresh level of success we're having right now. Sure. And so it's an evaluation period of like how deep do we want to go down this path? And we talk about it a lot because I think you do have to get to a place of financial stability to have that conversation to say, what do I, okay, now what do I want to do with this? And walking home, me, I give just some advice. If there's anybody that's a creator, keep your burn low.\", \"Hasan Minhaj's best advice for creators\": \" So I still keep my burn low. Like we lease, we lease our Honda Odyssey, shut out to white planes Honda. Oh yeah. Least payment is $538 a month. That shit's going back after three years. So we still lease the Honda. We rent. I don't own my house. We rent still. And what I do is I keep that capital available for 186K. And the capital that we have available allows me to have Tyler, PV, we have a full-time team and we're able to move quickly and nimbly on an opportunity. And if we need to put up the capital or the bag to do a co-pro deal on a movie, we can. I'm not going to lie though. I mean, again, I'm just as vulnerable as anybody else when I go to those architectural digest YouTube videos. And it's like, hi, I'm Dakota Johnson. And welcome to my airy Palm Springs. And I'm like, fuck, I have to give Richard the landlord a rent this month. By the way, so we're talking it's it's October 3rd. Yeah. Special comes out October 4th. How do you guys think it's going to do? Because I'm in a very vulnerable. I think it's going to do great. I think you said earlier, you're like, look, I did 168 shows with like in-person immediate feedback. And I've watched some of the behind the scenes on your YouTube channel actually that Tyler made of you. Work shopping the really early stuff before you even went on tour. This product you've put in the work in front of a very diverse and large amount of people. I'm not worried for you. Okay, got it. Yeah. Because you've tested it again and again. And again, right. Right. You know, I know I think in one of those videos, you said it was 110 minutes. It's not showing up on Netflix at 110 minutes. No, 66 now. Yeah. I think it's been tested. Yeah, my my perspective on it is that I think that through homecoming King and King's gesture, both they build depth and not width. And I think depth is the future. And all the creators that are going to last a long time are going to build depths. Oh, wow. Because the thing is I have I have a very deep connection with your story when you release your next piece. I'm there. Wow. Yeah, I'm already writing. Right. Like you're you're live and at the Civic's Arts Plaza again. I'm there. Wow. You know, like and that depth, I think the thing that I think a lot of artists don't fully realize is that you need depth with a very finite amount of people. You don't need millions and millions and millions of people. Right. Right. Right. That's width. And some people are built for width. Yeah, that's a famous celebrity game. Yeah. That's cool. But like you're building depth, like how deeply personal this piece is, how much like when I watch it, I have guttural reactions to the way you go from this range of emotions from laughter to complete silence. Uh-huh. And I'm like, I'm with you, right? And you mentioned this advice you got from from Pashant that like you were speaking too fast in some of your stand-up stuff. Yeah. And he said to like let the audience come to you. I think this special is the representation of that where like I felt like I was coming to meet you. You weren't coming at me. Yeah. You know, with information, you weren't telling a story about someone else. Yeah. You know, when I watch Patriot Act, like you're telling you're you're interspersing or like interstitial. There's stuff about you. Yeah. But this is about you. And I'm I'm clicking and deciding to stay for you. Wow. Thank you. And that's depth. And so that's my perspective on the King's Jester is like I don't think this is this should be gauged from a success perspective on how many people watch it. But on the impact you have on the people who do. Wow. Thank you. Yeah. I agree with that. I think it's so personal that what you're making can only be made by you. Yes. Oh, wow. And that's so interesting. Whereas like you mentioned like Top Gun Maverick like Miles Tellers in it. But if it was someone else, I would still watch it. Oh, right. Different mediums. Right. But like you're creating something so deeply personal. Yeah. Like if I make it through the full special. Yeah. And I enjoyed it. It's like I'm not going to forget that hour plus I just spent with him. Yeah. Human. I hope so. You know, and there's the you know, when we were in edit Tyler and PV and I were in the edit for almost two and a half months just editing it and picking our select shots and all that stuff and doing road on certain things and getting Ludwig Gornson to come in and compose music for it. And in the worst moments, there were these moments where I'm like, man, am I am I an author writing books in like a digital age? Is this a is this a thing that people don't want or care for anymore? And I remember Prashant told me after we were like in edit to like two or three o'clock in the morning and he was like, man, if you wanted to like live your life determining what the audience wanted, you and I should have just been executives. Where we're just these kind of creative VCs of like, that seems like a good idea. That seems like it's a good idea. He's like, we're on the other side of it because we have something to say. So the tension he's always reminding me of is like, don't don't just always be a network studio exec to your creative process. Try to keep that, keep that channel open and pure. And one of my favorite scenes and genius, the Kanye doc is when Ferrell listens to through the wire. Yeah. That's crazy. And was like, man, just keep that channel open of like that thing you really want to say. Yeah. And if that thing I want to say, it happens to hit at a moment like the White House correspondent's dinner or homecoming king or whatever. And it happens to match up with what the audience wants. Great. If not, just keep keep your burn low enough that you can still do this for another 40 years. I love that. I think the thing that I really respect about you is that you're not for everybody. And I think that maybe you don't, maybe you feel differently. But like I am very concerned about not like being for everybody. That anyone can come across something and be like, oh, I'm into this. But you are very much not for everybody. Like there's times where after homecoming king where I talked about your special in a group and there's some people were like, I don't like that guy. He talks too fast. He's too aggressive. Yeah. And I'm like trying to argue on your behalf. Oh, thank you. No, but I'm saying, like I was the one. I was like, I don't get it. I can't. Yeah. But when you have that, like when you're not for everybody, you build again, depth and passion with the people you are for. And I think that's like that's the that what builds longevity in this career in my opinion. I'm curious your perspective on how the regular output of specifically comedy has impacted the landscape of of comedy. Yeah. Where you know, you mentioned Tim Dylan, you mentioned Andrew Schultz, right? Yeah. You know, but Chrysher, Norman, Maru, like the list goes on and on. Output is wild. Yeah. It's great. You know, but Schultz puts out infamous in this crazy way. Yeah, it's great. It's amazing how it did that. And at the same time, you guys kind of gave them some advice. Yeah. Yeah. That was really fun. Yeah. I mean, that was super fun. And like we taught Schultz and I talk all the time. Yeah. His output is insane. Yeah. It's so much content. He's doing more creators than we are. He's really do. He's putting it. He got that creator. Yeah. Now he's like vlogging and streaming and like he's he's putting out a lot. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm curious your perspective on how the output of comedy has impacted just the landscape of comedy. Yeah. I think what's really beautiful is this is there was a period of time where comedy central and HBO knighted people. And generally, there's only five to ten people that could get him. And out of those five to ten people that got in, maybe three to four were theater acts and maybe one or two were stadium acts. Now in this decentralized landscape, I think there's almost 40 theater acts. Yeah. And there's probably 10 to 15 arena acts. That's great. I think that's really great. And I think what's awesome is is what Andrew's doing, what Tim is doing, what all those guys are doing is they're they're building that group of people that's like, I want to go see you in theaters. I want to go see you in arenas. And what's awesome, I think with that capital and freedom is now they can imprint their worldview on the world. However, they see fit. And it doesn't have to be backed by concast or viacom or time Warner or Netflix. So there's pros and cons to everything. And they got to they got to meet a demanding production schedule. But I think actually what they're showing is YouTube is now the new home for non scripted content. And I think streaming is now the home for premier scripted content. Interesting. Yeah. So when people are like late night is dead, it's not dead. The idea of a guy sitting there giving you their opinion with their friends. That's tough crowd with Colin Quinn. It's just now moved to YouTube. That's the home of non scripted shows. Right. And people like Marquis Brownlee that used to be a show on like CNET or these other traditional media legacy media players. Now he's his own CNET. But it's it's the category of it is non scripted. Now it's just on YouTube. So that's it. I just see it that way. If you want to scale your vision, you need 20 to 50 million dollars to do a movie or do a project. You go on streaming. If you want to be independent and the capital need is maybe $5 million or less. Yeah. You're on YouTube. And they're both great for different things. You know. I think you guys have pulled back a little bit from your YouTube channel. Yeah. Remember when you launched\", 'Why Hasan Minhaj stopped uploading to YouTube': \" it. What was the reason there? Was it like we're going to do this bring people behind the scenes, put butts in seats. Was it like a backup plan? Yeah. Sure. What was the thought there? I think there was a there was a thing of maybe let's show people the the making of this thing. I think the only problem is is the there isn't a ton of scalability after like four or five episodes. I get it. He's on the road. He's in a tour bus. He's in a green room. He's fixing jokes and he goes and he tries to joke out. So I think that was really it. The thing that I'm always juggling is the time capital spent doing that versus making and fixing the show and making the show great. Yeah. servicing that or fixing right now or in pre-production on the movie making sure that script is great. Versus like I got to service this thing this week. So I think if there was a world where I ever were to do like nonscripted a full-time show. Yeah. That's basically what Patriot Act was. Our YouTube channel Deep Cuts. All that stuff was a nonscripted YouTube show. I think a lot of our fans, those five, six million people that would rock with us every week came from YouTube and then there was a group of people that watched us Sundays on Netflix. How did you know\", \"When it's time to quit or keep going\": \" when things weren't working and when to move on from them in your dark career? Yeah. Yeah. I think like yeah. This is just a humility thing. Like you know what's really interesting is I've just gotten to this age where I realize life will chin check you and nobody comes out of this unscathed. I don't care where you are in the political spectrum. You look at Donald Trump's life and the licks he's taken. He's lost his brother to alcoholism. The bankruptcies he's filed for. Look at Joe Biden's life losing multiple children, losing a spouse, losing multiple runs for the presidency. Again, I'm not assigning qualitative value to either of them. I'm not here to get into a political argument. What I'm saying is the longer you play the game, you're going to get chin checked by life. And I realized nobody comes out of this thing unscathed. The humbling thing about life and the game is the game will reveal your hand. So when I was 18, 19 and you know I'm auditioning for things and things don't come my way, I had this vision. I was going to be on a sitcom and then I would go tour and those dreams die. Like eventually you hit an age and you're like 30 years old. You're not going to play a 19 year old anymore. It's over. That dream is over. I had a dream of doing a late night set on Conan. And like even on my Vimeo page it says Conan late night set v7.mov and you know that private Vimeo link you send. And by the time I even was able to get on the show, I was already like the daily show. It's over. That dream died. You know I was never able to do that thing that I always dreamed of. I'm 37 now. Like I can't play certain roles that 25 year olds can play. And that's okay. Like things ending, things dying is actually okay. That's part of life. Life is about graduating. So to answer your question, the game just checked me. So it was no different than me trying out for the basketball team. I tried my best. I'm a senior. This is the last year I can try out for varsity. It's over. And you cry, you mourn and you just move on. And the time that I've spent with OGs, they're really good at mourning and letting go. And that's okay. That's part of life. And that's that's really what happened. You know, some of those dreams ended in new things happened. And that's okay. And I think it's for the best man. Do you imagine about 37? I dress like a 19 year old. And I'm still playing that like L.A. Peter Pan syndrome game. I mean, there's guys that are like 47 years old. And they dress like they're 23. It's it's horrifying. But look at you know what I mean? You're just like what is what is wrong with you? You can move on. Yeah, totally. You know, and you look at people. I even look at like my fashion icons, music icons, Janelle Monet, David Beckham, Farell Williams. They have aged so gracefully. And they've aged with a level of like sanity and clarity in their thoughts. Man, oh man, you meet some people that were like hot in the 90s, early 2000s. You're like, bro, what's happening upstairs? Like what happened to you? You know, and they didn't mourn and move on. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like it's okay. Like life is about graduate. You got to graduate, mourn it and move on. You know, and so I got it. And you got to do that with humility. So whether these next projects that I do work or fail, I come to it with humility. It's between God, the audience, they decide. I love that. Appreciate that. That was a good perspective. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I really got to do religious again. But it's the best facts. There's no getting around this. Yeah. You know, I mean like that speaks to like the long game that this is. I appreciate it. I appreciate it. Now with you guys. Thank you so much. Thank you. Yeah. This is such a dope conversation. Yeah. This is awesome. Yeah. You guys are great. Appreciate it. Yeah.\"}, 4: {}, 5: {}, 6: {'The Mythical Machine, Explained.': \" Let's all do nothing but this right now. Make it as good as we possibly can and then say, oh, we won't do it again for another month. So it's basically finding all the efficiencies you can in your schedule. And it, and I don't know, somehow we've, I don't think that would necessarily be fulfilling for, again, it kind of go back to this like, if you're just a pure artist and you like, wait for the inspiration and you follow the creative flow and that's how, how you operate. So that's a beautiful thing and probably the majority of artists and they're going to kind of like, kind of maybe work on their own. Maybe they have an assistant or something like that. But we just, our aspirations were to just build something together and have this team and see what we can do. And it's kind of like playing a game and figuring out a puzzle for us. And so we, we, we take a little pleasure in finding those efficiencies and being like, yeah, we can shoot 12, let's shoot 12 sketches today. So beyond good Mythical Morning and how you guys are operating, like, how does the company actually work? What is the pie chart of how money is made in this creative company? Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, going back, this isn't even really something that we really started focusing\", 'How Rhett \\\\u0026 Link made money': \" super closely on to like 2015, 2016, right? But definitely when we started really taking a look at it, we were the biggest piece of the pie and also the majority of the pie was YouTube revenue. And so we were like, okay, well, it's kind of inevitable that this is the biggest piece of the pie given that our flagship properties are YouTube first. And that's where the best monetization is. When you say YouTube revenue, you mean add sense. I mean add sense. Okay, got it. Yeah. But we were like, we want to actively work to make the pie bigger, but to make this piece of the pie smaller in relation to the rest of the pie. And so over the course of like what, you know, six years or so, we have gotten to a place where while the YouTube add sense revenue piece is the largest piece of the pie, it is not the majority. Not really close to the majority at this point. You know, e-commerce business has just grown very significantly and are just straight up integration business. So on a top of add sense, but just straight brand integrations has grown significantly. So those are really the, and also our community, what we call the community piece of the pie with the Mythical Society, right? Those are our biggest sort of the content, you know, commerce and community. Those are the biggest pieces of the pie. And then there's other things that are, you know, more speculative like the stuff we do in traditional or, okay, books and that kind of thing, which is not, it's not constant. It's like, oh, you might get a book deal and then a few years past, you might get another one that kind of thing tend to be the smaller pieces of the pie. And live shows go into that as well. Yeah. Yeah.\", 'Why Rhett \\\\u0026 Link launched Mythical': \" So from things like that, like shooting shows to all the sudden we have mythical, which is such a bigger thing, is that like a deliberate decision to not just make shows and content, but have an overarching media company. And was there, I'm so curious about this, of like, if there was a moment where you guys were like, well, we could be retin' link and have good Mythical Morning and build that. And that's a fantastic career. But then this moment of like, but let's actually, let's build a bigger company than that. Honestly, I think it started from a very practical place of just like, what's our retirement plan? I think it was just like, we're not going to do this forever. We're not going to appeal to this audience forever. When are they going to get tired of us? I don't want to go back to being an engineer. I don't want to have to go work for somebody. Like, you just, and so it's like, okay, what can we do? We've got this platform. We like making content. We know what makes good content. We know how to recognize somebody who will work well with this kind of audience. So let's just see what else we can get people interested in. For me, that was the thinking. And then once it starts working, like, once you do something like, oh, you know, you watch somebody like Mythical Chef Josh go from the guy who just makes really interesting food to the guy who can make really interesting food, but can also be very interesting as he's doing it and telling you about it. Like, we love that process of seeing somebody kind of come into their own. And now Mythical Kitchen, like, that team over there is, they're playing the game that we used to play of like, oh, here's an idea. Let's try it. Let's see how they respond to it. You know, we might go show up on an episode of something over there from time to time. And we obviously are kind of keeping up with what they're doing on a high level and how the team is expanding and all this stuff. But when it comes to that, the game, playing that creative feedback game that you have to play to be a creator, they're doing that in a self-sustaining way. And it's just a fun process to be a part of. We want to replicate that. Can you expand upon playing that feedback game?\", 'How to play the YouTube game and win': \" I think that's an important thing to discuss. We actually both, we just took a break and we both read Creativity Inc. We guys read that. Great book, yeah. It's a great book. And there's a lot of that discussion around, you know, exploring the neighborhood, quote, unquote, discussion around failure of like, I got this idea. I just got to go down the path and see. And I'll be okay with failure because every, whatever I do, it'll yield new information for me. Exactly. You know, and like, that was, I've never, I haven't read a book that reminded me so much of what our day to day life feels like, you know, of trying something and it not working. And then the past 10 years, we tried so many things, but those have all informed what we do today. Right. And I'm just curious about, if you could expand on that feedback game that creators have to play. Yeah. I mean, it's, I mean, the, when we talk about the, when something works, it's like, we had to learn to say, okay, we're looking for things to work. We are saying this is a test and then we're going to take action based on it. It's like you start to develop that feed. Yeah. You start to plan to the feedback mechanism. And you know, I think that when we, when we first said, is Cinco de Mayo in 24, 2015, whenever we did Will it Taco? Let's just throw stuff in a taco for an episode. It was just an episode idea. And then we, you know, it actually took us a little while to realize, we should do that again, but not with tacos. We should do Will it as a sub series. Yeah. And so, but we had that signal. Then you get to a point where it's, you know, okay, we, our risk is low. We have five videos every day. We can learn something from every single video. Everyone can be another Will it Taco. So now we're like looking for it. We're trying to like, trying to remember what led to Will it Taco. So then you can build a, systems for a team to then come up with more of those things. Yeah, every, every video that goes up, there's people that watch the performance of the video and then change the thumbnail. It's like you, you start to say, what else, what else can we change? Yeah. Can we change the title? Can we change the thumbnail? Can every little thing make it perform better? Everything's an experiment. And then, well, you have to, as every creator, if you want to be a successful creator, you have to embrace the fact that your audience is not only the final audience, but they're also your focus group. Traditional media, you've got the focus group and then you've got the intended audience. And that distinction goes away. Your fans are your focus group. And if you don't listen to them, you're not going to be a successful creator long-term. And you also, we were just talking about this earlier today, there's two aspects to your content. There's the product and there's the performance. And a lot of really, you know, creatively, purest people can never accept that the performance of the content. And so therefore, like the marketing, the title and the thumbnail are important and potentially just as important or more important than the content itself. Now, we've always said the content is king and we want to have a great product and we're never going to let that suffer. But getting people to watch that is such an important part of it. You don't embrace the quality of the product and then the performance itself of that product. It just can't happen. It's going to lose too much steam. So on the first half, it's like you find signal that something is working. Can we do this better next time? You know, can we double down on this? Can we triple down on this? Is this a format that we can do every month? You know? And then you get to a point where once you do that, it's actually harder to find the signal for when you should stop doing something when you need to move off. Interesting. That's the real challenge. It's easy. Like, oh, this video works. That's easy. Let's do it again. I believe in this video. It didn't work. But if we tweak these things, it'll happen again or it'll find its audience. So this format can work. But then, like, how much longer are we going to do with it episodes of Good Mythical Morning? We do one a month. Like, for eight years now? So it's like, well, how much longer are we going to do this? Like, how much food are we going to continue to do on Good Mythical Morning? Like, what is the signal of ambivalence? You know? That's a real challenge for us at this point. Like, don't hold on to your old signals too long. Well, and this is something that every long-term creator struggles with as well is the\", 'How to experiment on YouTube': \" audience expectations kind of keep you in a certain place. And experimentation outside of those expectations is not rewarded with clicks. And so you're actually more incentivized in the short term to return to formats and milk things that really, really worked with you. And he means literally milk milk things in our case. And the thing that we are, because it's going into the 10th year, or I guess that going into the 11th year of the show, the thing that we really been focusing on. It's, we're halfway through the 11th year. Yeah, we are. And we are. Yeah. Having to basically say, hey, we're going to take this risk. We're going to do this thing. And it's funny, the feedback that you get from the clicks, the views, and then the long-term viewer. So right here in this very spot, we recently attempted to put a shoe on a horse. I mean, an actual horse shoe. Oh, so you're being serious. You're being serious. Oh, yeah, very serious. Yeah. I do not recommend doing it either. I haven't done it. I may hold it. Yeah. Yeah. And so that's an idea of an episode where, you know, okay, the long-term fans are like, I love it when you guys do these things that are kind of outside the box and it really makes me, you know, they get very vocal about it. But we get a report from, you know, our guy whose job is it to give us the report that said, well, this, will we die shoe in a horse video? Is the, is number 10 of your last 10 videos. Oh, yeah. And so what does that mean? Does that mean we should never shoe a horse again? Well, there's a, what about the other three legs? Mm-hmm. Now, what, I mean, what does this really mean? And the fact that you don't put a shoe right up? Because also it's like your first time experimenting. Try putting a shoe on it. On that, that format. Yeah. That, that's the thing that I think is terrifying as creators, especially as like for us, with as you start to have newly found momentum, you get a 10 out of 10. You're like, well, let's never do that again. Even if it was like, okay, we just need to build on it. The audience, like, it's something new. But it's terrifying to experiment when you're up against YouTube. So I imagine you got pitched the idea about the shoe on the horse. I think that was that, that was our idea. I think so. Yeah, because for good mythical summer, we specifically were saying, let's do some more experimental, more experiential stuff. And I was like, we love watching those, you know, those videos on TikTok where they're changing some of the, they're just like, yeah, yeah. Of course, those are good videos. Yeah. How do we make that a side and do it? It's easy to do that. Yeah, it kind of. Yeah. So quick and easy. Yeah. Right. That's satisfying. Yeah. And so that is something that we're really talking about with the team is, you know, how do you maintain? Because this, not, it's hard to stay encouraged when you do something that everybody here, everybody at Mythical and then all the like hardcore long-term fans are very excited about it. It gets 60, 50, 60% of what you would get if you just set there and ate something funny at the table. Yeah. And so, but our theory is that you've got to invest in those long-term fans or else you're just going to have a really, really slow declination, you know. Yeah. Do you shoe a horse or do you beat a dead horse? Oh, nice. That's a lot of them now. That's it. Wow. You shoe the horse. I think what's cool is to look back in time and look at this feedback game you guys are playing on YouTube and understanding like, Rhett's most embarrassing moment followed by the next day, uploading links most embarrassing moments. And like, you look at that and I think quantity of uploads really supports that feedback game, right? Like you don't, you're not waiting a week to try it again. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, if you're going to say this works, let me go back and look at the last six months of their channel. Yeah. Oh, he tried this character, but he didn't have the accent down. And then he tried this character. And then eventually they got to a place where they were doing the same thing every single time. And there's something beautiful in seeing the result of that game having been one, but then there's, especially on the short form scale of Tik Tok, I'm just like, oh man, what's you going to do next? Yeah. Yeah, because he's like, he's gonna do this character forever. I thought about that with the drone dancing guy. Remember that guy? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It was, I was like, oh wow, how long does this, the dancing go, you know? Yeah, yeah. And you just said, remember that guy, which maybe that guy's not gonna like, because he might still be doing it. But I mean, that was like everywhere on TikTok. And so one advantage that GMM has is that, well, it's still at its core is a variety show where we're not doing the same thing every single day. There may be, it may seem like, oh, this feels like a remix of this idea or whatever, but it really is a playground for ideas and it's not a character doing a bit for half a minute and that's it. And you gotta do the same thing every time. But I remember, you know, you talk about the most embarrassing episodes back to back. That reminded me, there was a certain point\", 'How Good Mythical Morning adapted': \" when we had the conversation, we're gonna run out of stories. Like what is good Mythical Morning, good and be? And so that's when you started to work in more formats. Yeah. You know, let's play games with each other. You'll know all the answers I want. Oh, we can switch it back and forth. You know what? Oh, let's see if we can taste if something's from Walmart or Target, you know? Just just an idea. Yeah. I mean, good God. Look at us now. You know, it's like, I mean, look at all the stuff we eat. But again, it's like, okay. And then you, it's still the same challenge. Like, where are we going with all this? You know, we gotta, you know, this belief that the bottom is gonna fall out. I don't, I feel pretty good about that not happening at this point. But I'm still very much engaged in what? Where are we gonna take this show? Because it will, you know, if you just keep following the same signals, then they'll, you know, it'll, it's a downward spiral. If you keep doing the same thing, yeah. What's that, what's that saying? It does seem to like, like the basis of the show, fortunately, is just getting to hang out with you two. Hopefully. It is like whether you're eating food, which is like what's happening right now, or occasionally chewing a horse. Yeah. You go back years and years, the one constant is that we're getting to hang out with you. Yeah. Right. And you do have to play a little bit of that game, obviously. But you've built such a loyal group of people over the years that are excited for whatever your... Yeah, they're gonna come back. It's really those, it's the margin between those who are gonna watch every day and those who are just gonna click on the stuff that entices them. And apparently, as we have proven that putting food in the thumbnail makes, I guess everyone's just hungry. I kind of relate to that. People are hungry most of the time. Yeah. It's universal. That's the thing. It's like we all can understand what it feels like to eat food. And when we see you eat disgusting food or weird food, it's like I can also kind of have that sensation a little bit in my mind. So it's relatable. It's relatable. It's enjoyable. I can place myself a bit there. I'm curious at this point, how important is external validation\", 'Are Rhett \\\\u0026 Link proud?': \" for you to personally have like showing up on Fallon or I was watching Hot Ones and Sean Evans brought up how post Malone when he was on the show said he was like a huge fan. No, he did it for four years. Yeah, he is. Like, that was cool. Yeah. I think you guys rank those types of experiences now in your career next to maybe when an episode does really well. Like how important are those moments? Yeah, I mean, it really depends. Like, I mean, some of the biggest career moments for us are because we are of an age that's like, all right, the fact that the first song that we ever wrote in middle school, we performed on the tonight show with the roots backing of stuff. Yeah, I mean, that's the career highlight. The fact that yeah, that post Malone is a fan and then he turns out to be such a sweetheart is a doubly great. I think it's all based on, this is a theory and I've seen it proven true time and time again. Whatever was most thrilling and valuable to you when you were 10 years old, those are the validation experiences that will be the most meaningful to you for the rest of your life. Getting a lot of views on a YouTube video, that didn't exist when I was 10 years old, right? The tonight show existed. Rockstars existed. And so it's in your DNA in some way to really value what would have been the coolest thing that you could have experienced as a kid? And then when you get to experience those things as an adult, it's always gonna seem more meaningful. That's why every bone back home gets excited when we get a show on the Food Network. Because they're in the same boat, like TV, when I was a kid, the best thing you could be on was TV. Red Linker on TV now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know their daily show gets more views than that Food Network show, but, you know, TV, TV, I am on TV. Yeah, so TV or TV. Yeah, so yeah, going on Fallon, as many times as we've done it, and it doesn't translate into views. Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure. Everybody's like, I just thought I was gonna discover you guys on Fallon. But we don't see like an increase in subscribers or anything. It's just this validating experience to be able to do something that you would have thought was really cool when you were 10 years old. When you guys look ahead, how long do you feel\", 'Will Rhett \\\\u0026 Link retire from Good Mythical Morning?': \" like you can do the show? And do you want to do the show? And where does the show go? Like how does it keep you guys going? You know, our desire for a good Mythical Morning is we really feel like, I mean, speaking of the tonight show and what it was like to be the way we perceived that as a kid, is you perceive the tonight show to be this institution that kind of, you know, oh, my dad watched this and now I watch it. Now I watch it and my kids will probably watch it. It was this entertainment institution. I think we're begun to see the potential for a good Mythical Morning to feel like that, you know, culturally. So I think what that means for us is that, I mean, as long as people are still interested in watching it, I mean, I'm too much of a performer to say that I'm gonna just do it. I'm gonna run it to the ground even when people have lost interest except a couple of hundred people who are just like, we still want more. But as long as people are still engaged and still enjoying it and we're still engaged and we're still enjoying it, which our mission is always to find ways for us to keep enjoying it and mix it up, which we've gotten pretty good at. I don't think I can put a number on it. How long will we'll do it? Yeah, I think right now, we're very engaged in terms of what's next for Good Mythical Morning? And how do we lead our team through that? And I'm just mean a creative iteration where we're, what are the new things we can be excited about? I think right now, we're excited about that development. Like, Good Mythical Morning is at a juncture where, okay, how are we gonna evolve the show beyond what it is right now? Instead of chasing that feedback loop, which I'll say, specifically the food feedback loop. How do we break the show out of that? Because we're just not comfortable being defined in that way by people who, if you know, you know, but we'd still like more people to know that that's not what the show actually is, especially, and if you watch Good Mythical More, I mean, and you're a dedicated fan of that, if you know, you know what we've started to say. And it's like, I think it's exciting that there's so much potential there, like the heart of Good Mythical Morning is still beating. Still beating, like Huey Lewis said. And so I think we're excited about what we're gonna, where it's gonna go. So to me, that's really all that matters. It matters the most, you know? And then that people are watching, and those things are hand in hand, and then we don't go broke doing it for some reason. Right. We have to start paying YouTube to do it. Right. That would probably be an issue. That would be an issue for everyone. Do you think there's a point where maybe, you know,\", \"GMM's new hosts?\": \" same as the tonight show as an institution and new hosts come through that new hosts would maybe take over? I think that our mentality on that, I can say we are not actively seeking that at this point, but if it comes down to the show not existing, looking at these guys. Yeah, I saw. Link looked at me with a totally different eyes right there, and I was like, am I, how do I do this audition right now? If we have to choose between the show, stopping or continuing with other hosts who can do a great job, hopefully better than us, then that will definitely continue to show. But how would that happen? Yeah. Impossible. Is it? You think it's impossible? I think there's no world where it's the same, you know? Maybe. So yeah, I don't know. And like John Stewart left the daily show, and like it's not the same, but there's another version of it. Yeah, it's interesting because I think when that happens, it'll be an experiment that, I guess it, I know that Ray William Johnson tried to do that for a while or he's just doing guest hosts. Guest hosts. He's back now. Yeah, he's back now with a different show, right? Go for him, by the way. Yeah. But yeah, it'll be an experiment because yeah, it's been done time and time again with traditional television properties. Right. And yes, it's like people, I don't like this new person. And then all of a sudden there's a lot of people like, oh, I didn't watch John Stewart. I only watched Trevor Noah. Yeah. So again, no, no, even short term plans for that, like there's even long term, there's no plans at all for that right now. But that is the way that we see us, us stopping the show is giving it to somebody else one day. Yeah. Not us just stopping the show and just walking off into the sunset. That could also, we could change our minds. Well, if there isn't somebody, if there's not somebody who wants to do it, who, who, who, who, you know, who we want to do it. Yeah. I mean, I've heard some people say it's impossible. I did, yeah. So thanks so much for sitting down with us. Yeah. Thanks for having us. I'm glad we chat with you guys. We're all in a lot of space. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for having us. And now we're gonna go check out the rest of the space. Yeah. Let's do a tour. Yeah. Yeah.\"}, 7: {\"Cody Ko \\\\u0026 Noel Miller on Ending That's Cringe\": \" I think we both like trying new things and pushing ourselves and learning especially.

So was music starting to play a bigger role during that time? It was. Yeah. Yeah. And so we, yeah, music continued to kind of be a factor. And then the pandemic hit. And then I think that's when, when the pandemic hit out, naturally, everyone like re, you know, they kind of thought about things more in like what does the future look like? And I think that was an easy moment for us to be like, well, probably not going to be like wrapping about Dix for very long. So like, maybe we should, you know, try some other things that present more of a challenge and something we can like really care about really sync our teeth into. Yeah. With your music, like I was talking to Cody about this, like some of the streams on Spotify and your guys music are crazy. Yeah. I think I'm pretty sure Walkman is almost gold. Yeah. It's like 86 or 90 million streams and like broke bitch. Uh, it's like 45, 47 million. And I also put on that song. Yeah. When I was doing some research for this podcast, right? I've heard that song. Yeah. But I put it on and I was like, how, how serious were you when you were making this song? You kind of like, did you, because that's like a good song. And I don't know the time, like the emphasis on like the comedy being a main character started to maybe like, not that it went down, but like the quality of the music started to do. It was almost like you guys were flexing in this way of like, no, we could have, like if we were, yeah, it was like awkward for watching. It was like, this is like, just, this is just, just, you know, like, actually wanted to do this. You could just do this. That's what we were going for. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know what it is. It's awkwardly good. Well, next to all of the other music that comedians or just even YouTubers put on YouTube, it just, it was the same character. It's got to be Josh Richards though. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. I think it's funny, because when some people break down the music, it's really interesting to see what their interpretations of it are, like even hearing what you guys have to say is really interesting, because I guess the general theme here is that the things that we made, we never had these really deep thoughts about it. It's funny when I'll go on the road. And even to this day, and I've had people ask, like, what, what, like, what was your process, like making music? And I'm like, it's very complicated. Someone makes a beat and then mean Cody, look at each other and say, do you want to go first? And then one of us records. And then the other one goes, yeah, that, that works. And then the other one records and then we're like, yeah, sick. And a lot of it is supported by the producers that we know, just between like Spock and Diamond Pistols there. They're, they're always the ones to really make the music like do something. So yeah, I do feel they got to a point where it was getting just like a little too far away from comedy. And I'm like, maybe it's a little too horny now. That's too horny. I think for me, like, broke bitch was the moment where I was like, this is a little too good. Like this song, I can casually listen to it. Like, I like this song. And that's when it was like, I felt like there was an inflection point of life. But these guys are just going to become like a music. Yeah, yeah. Make good music. No, because there's the music industry is the worst industry to be part of. Let's dig into that. Yeah. Yeah. I want to, I want to hear about it. So, it's actually interesting because you're bringing up Joji, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay, someone can be like a comedian, have funny videos on YouTube and then go into music. Oh, I think I'm going to be successful. Yeah, yeah. Like Tim Heidecker does music now. A lot of people do it for sure.\", 'The Problem with Singing a Record Deal': \" But I think what's interesting is the business side and the money side of music. A lot of people hear that labels working with labels isn't like the best experience or whatever. But when we were independent, like, you know, and then it wasn't even a conscious decision. It was just like, oh, yeah, we're putting out music. Let's just do it on our own because we have a marketing platform built in. We can just make a video on YouTube and like, we were making a lot of money. Yeah. Like from streams. Yeah, we're making a good chunk. Like, like, you know, I don't even, I won't put a number on it. But like, it was good, like for an independent, you know, for people in our project. Yeah. Like, it generated a significant amount of income and then we signed with a label and we made zero money. But I mean, like, that's, you know, that's no shade to the label or anything, like, I think. That's just how it works. Yeah. And why did you go for make sense for people that don't have that platform that we had worked so long to build already? We did it as kind of like a legitimacy thing. It was like, we signed with a label and, you know, then we're on the same label that was like Posner. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. You know, Aristotle goes way back. Yeah. Yeah. You know, famous name. So it was legitimacy, but also you get an advance. We got to do it. We got to do it. But no, could you explain like, why does the money go down so significantly? Yeah. It's theft. No. The contract that they make you sign has a lot of built-in things that you discover along the way. Got it. Mostly it's, it's recruitment. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what really fucks you is that, you know, they give you this advance and it's money which is one of your album, right? Yeah. They also take a long time to give you that as well. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I like everyone that works at the label like they were all really great and had the best intentions. Like, and like I said, it works for other people. Right. But I think for us, like we're, we've always been so independent and we've always done everything by ourselves. Yeah. That that relationship just didn't really work as well for us. And it's also like the industry was changing so much. Like I don't know the record label would think like the way you guys did that SeatGeek integration in one of your music videos. Yeah. But we did that because otherwise that money would have came out of our, our recruitment. So like, but they pay you a certain amount of money and then to like fund your album or whatever. But then you only receive royalty money after you've paid that back and then all the marketing fees on top of that. Right. Yeah. So they a lot of certain amount of money towards music videos or whatever, but the rest, you have to pay that back. So you end up paying for everything. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How it's traditionally been. Yeah. Fun fact about broke pitch. So there's a crazy like sequence of events because basically we needed to finance it. So I pitched like, okay, what if we do this ad at the end and we can kind of tied into a story. Like, oh, great. Simultaneously, I don't know if I think I can say this. I pitched a key from Key and Peel directly to be like in the music video. Like I had a phone call with him and he was down, but then because we had the ad in it, it created like red tape because he was committed to other things, which yeah. So it was like a very surreal thing to be talking to key and just hearing his voice. And he was like, okay, yeah, I like this. And I'm like, whoa, this is fucked up. And then, you know, unfortunately, it didn't pan out. But we noticed that a good video. But yeah, that whole. And then we almost had, we almost had Courtney Cox in the video for Daddy. Really? Yes. We've almost had a lot of great kids. I've never quite pulled through for music videos at least. Yeah. I mean, we've had some pretty great guests. Yeah. I pitched John Cena for Daddy. Yeah. Didn't hear back from his agents. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And then we got like experimentation. And when it comes to, I guess early days making a decision to try something and stop it, how maybe the have those stakes increase now that you have DMG studios or just like the stuff you guys have built. Like you experimentation gets harder when you have overhead, right?\", 'Personal projects vs TMG': \" Yeah. And you have payroll and people or like a mortgage and you're like, yeah. Well, I could experiment or I can just do the thing that works. I think we tend to do it on our individual channels. Yeah. We are working on some stuff though. And we, but yeah, but I guess like it's a two part answer. So we are working on stuff between us. But because now we have to factor in the network and how that plays out like it's a much harder thing to pull the trigger on. Yeah. We definitely have to have deeper conversations about, okay, how does this impact the money? We also don't want to do anything that impacts our ability to support the other shows that we have want to make sure they're taking care of. So there's that aspect of it. And then so I think it's easier sometimes when we individually are like, I wonder if this will work and we can try like some version of it. And then we can almost like proof of concept, some idea and then we can bring that to the network as well. So I think we have two avenues for that still got it. I was just going to say I think we're also pretty good at like taking calculated risks. Yes. Yeah. I think that's like just starting on Patreon as a good example. Like that allowed us to fund the podcast in the beginning and then get a studio and make those take risks with our content and stuff like that and try different things because we knew we had a little bit of a safety net in terms of. And we're good at doing that now. It's like we're never going to stop the main money maker as the podcast. But as long as that's going, then we can mess around with Cody and Noel Dues and try moment house shows and like really try to develop new formats. Yeah. Do you guys talk about or do you have to talk about like how you're going to experiment personally or you're always aware of that just in case you're like, you know what? Actually that would be good if we do it on TMG. Yeah. Not really because I feel I don't feel anything is really sacred anymore unless you know start some extremely unique series to yourself. But I think if you're just throwing out general premises, I think it doesn't matter because I did like this entire game show that no one gave a shit about and it's fine because we just repurposed a lot of it. I thought that was funny. Oh, thanks dude. Yeah, I remember that. I was great. Well produced. Thank you. Yeah. But in doing that, it was dope because I learned so much and then I was able to just say, oh, we could repurpose this aspect for like a Cody and Well do or, oh, let's do this concept and I know it'll work because we worked on these things peripherally and we can adapt it into that. So when it comes to like the stuff we do together, it's always going to be unique because it's just us too. Yeah. You know, even if Cody does some video concept by himself, if he does it with me, it's automatically different. So yeah, I don't think that anything is like super awful. Or it's never a situation of like, you fucked it. If we just did it together and instead of by yourself, you know, it would have worked better. It doesn't matter. Was it ever a point where we're can together where you guys felt like your identity was so wrapped up in two of you working together? It's too late for that. Just too late. Because I feel like for us, it's that way 100%. Our brand is not, it's our names. Yeah. Yeah. I think we're at that point to a certain extent, where certain people only know the stuff that we do together and forever will get comments on our individual channels that is like, where's the other guy? Yeah, yeah. The other guy's like, comparison all that shit. But we're also pretty careful in maintaining our own individual stuff. It's like a sanity thing. It's like we're both creatives. So if we don't have a medium outside of TMG to experiment and work on our own stuff, I think we'd both go insane. Yeah. Yeah, because I think you, that's a weird thing that people don't, I think, really see, is that when you do a lot of work with a creative partner, like every aspect of the business, if it's doing well, starts to squeeze you two together into everything. Like, you know, then before you know it, like every brand wants you to only work together and everyone's only pitching you to work together. And you go insane because you have to have your own sense of self. Like that is super crucial. I mean, that's just like a basic thing in life. You need time to yourself. And I think the same holds true for your work. So yeah. Yeah, I think it comes across with you guys too, which I really respect and think, like, no, while you're short film. Oh, thanks, man. You know, like flipping that on on YouTube and you're just like, whoa, this is a total, this is just a creative expression. That's, it's just, if you say you, you openly like sabotage yourself on YouTube in a, in a potentially YouTube algorithmic sense. Yeah. But from an artistic perspective, it's really enjoyable to watch your channel and see a new format that's comedic and then a music video for you. So I think it is interesting whether the platform rewards it or not. Yeah, it doesn't. It doesn't, it firms. Confirm that too. Yeah. But we, like, we're terrified of experimentation. Yeah. We appreciate it. So I would say like we are, it's like a scary thing to experiment. Yeah. Especially when you build a business around something that it's like working. Yeah. And I was curious, Cody, you talked about that a bit around, well, mainly around like some of the challenges\", 'Cody Ko on creating uninspired work': \" of creating YouTube videos and maybe feeling uninspired or not as inspired to me. Yeah. I don't want to put words in your mouth here. But I think that's something like a channel you're at least responding to. I'm one of your streamers. Are you saying my videos all right? Is that what you're saying? No, yeah. No, it's definitely something that I've been feeling lately. I think like we both go through those, definitely. Zones where it's just like this whole world is up and down and up and down. You know, and there's some moments where it's just like, fuck, I just, everything I do feels dry. It feels like it doesn't have a soul or a purpose. And I think I'm a big fan of like momentum. And when it feels like something's working that really excites me like, like that I like it, but also other people like it. And you know, for a while, I just like wasn't finding that. And that's those moments where you have to sit back and just reevaluate and be like, well, it's just because I'm doing the, I'm doing the same thing and expecting different results. Right. It's like, but that's also what YouTube, like you're expecting a different emotional result. But like from, but as Tony and his member, it's like, I, I can only watch someone do one thing for so long. And that's like four years, you know? That's the period where it's like, okay, if this guy doesn't grow or evolve to the next thing or find something else, like I'm gonna fizzle out as an audience member, which you see happen all the time.\", 'The absurdity of YouTube': \" And I think that's one of the reasons why we've been able to like, you know, survive this long in this industry is because we keep trying to things and we keep evolving and learning and trying to better ourselves as, you know, creators. How much of what's happening on YouTube at large affects the decisions you guys make, like in your personal content on TMG, we were talking yesterday again about, it's hard when you look at YouTube and someone who's brand new will upload a video that's like, I traveled to every country in the world and that's their first video. Like that's the fault. Like that's the fault about it. Yeah. We talk about it a lot because like, we're, you know, we're having these conversations, like I said amongst ourselves about, you know, new formats for TMG and experimentation. And then we're, but we're like, what the fuck do we do? Because all of a sudden this, I see this video from this kid and it's like, I went to every Gordon Ramsay restaurant in the world. Yeah. This is like his fourth YouTube video ever. He must have spent 50 grand on it and then he edits it down to like four minutes. Yeah. How the fuck are we supposed to compete with that when that's the new bar of success on YouTube? Oh, bar car, man. You know? Yeah. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I've been saying it for years. Yeah. Let's blow up a car. No one's on the same team for years. Yeah. No, I think, well, I couldn't have talked about this before in our podcast, but the way I kind of boiled it down, which I think is really funny is everyone is speedrunning their YouTube career. So they're doing this really intense concepts right away. Yeah. And you can only visit so many restaurants all over the world, so many times. Before Cafe. Yeah. What did I just say? Great. Just on a TV. That's fine. But I do think there is something to be said about how the algorithm is motivating absurdity. Before it used to be like, look at this goofy movie that I saw. Now it's like, I watch every movie from this director. Now, you know. And it's on me. I was like someone's eye. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think it's necessarily sort of interrupt, but I don't think it's necessarily the algorithms fault. It's just because people are so much shit that that's what you've seen everything. Wow, this is something new. Yeah. Yeah, people have seen everything. So that's where, yeah, I think it comes down to doing crazy shit. Like that's really all that's left. Like some of the ideas I've come up with for us, the two of them are like, oh, how the fuck do we pay for that? I'm like, we find a way. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's really funny. I just have to say guys, I said blow up a cart. I didn't even say it. Cody said it twice now. Right. And the way they smiled, I'm just saying. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just saying. And again, like this is serendipitous that we have a car for you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It really is. Yeah. I think we manifest a bit more. I think this is the lead out to this moment. I think the biggest key to our career is actually this book called The Secret. I don't know if you've heard it. We just manifest it being a media executive. Right. Right. That's how we did. Yeah. But you know what? One genre that feels like it's still kind of holding strong or like a lot of it has been, like it's not as crazy is the commentary genre. Like the reaction. Yeah. It's like Drew Goodin or Jarvis Johnson. Yeah. Yeah. There's something, especially Drew, it's like for me, I find it's own enjoyable to just sit and listen to his like kind of intellectual analysis of something. But even his videos have gotten a little bit crazier. Like when he's buying every ad on Instagram, that's the series that's hitting. Like that's a, that's a, you know, comparison idea. Yeah, compared to sitting at a computer and reacting to something. Yeah. That's not way way to it. It's like you can tell how much effort he put into that and money too. Like he's buying a business, you know? What? For the Ninja Dio. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Everything on YouTube is going that direction. So I think it's going to be very interesting to see where things go. Even with, even with TikTok, I think it's funny that there's this youth that speedrunning all of the, especially with TikTok. Yeah. All the styles of content. Yeah. You know, that to me is the same as like when Nio laid back and like they, like plugged in the check in his head and they're like, and he goes, now I know Kung Fu. That's what these kids are doing. They're laying down and I like watching TikTok and they're just rolling their eyes in their head. They're getting like decades of sketch comedy injected in their brain over 12 months. Yeah. Plus like vlogging, plus everything. Yeah. Food tutorials, like everything. They're, they are getting way too much internet in such a short period of time. So I'm always curious to see where these people net out in like two or three years. I was wondering what it will do to society when like you're in high school and you've consumed so much about like entrepreneurialism, about going to college. Like how do you even go to college when you, like you feel like you've lived it all? Like you've seen everything. Yeah. It's like it's a DMT. That's how it's left. That's right. I don't know. I think it's a, it's a weird future that we're about to live in. I think even your guys videos are like obviously they've progressed significantly from you guys sitting and watching stuff. And it's a complex, the concepts are complex. You're like the out of touch concept. Yeah. Yeah. You're next for that by the way. That was a really funny concept. Oh, that was great. Yeah. That's a really good, because we get to play along too. Yeah. I got to play along with you. That was really fun. Yeah. Thanks, man. Yeah. Your edits are incredibly complex. Like the way, you're, Did you watch the ukulele video that I did? Yeah. That was like my first like, adventure into this world of like, okay, I'm going to try an idea that's bigger than just be sitting at a desk. Like I got to like set a goal and try something. But I don't want to spend $20,000 on it. So yeah, we're definitely, no dude, spending 20k for 100,000 views. Yeah. Yeah. You should do it sometimes. It's really fulfilling, it's really rewarding. Really rewarding, yeah. And then to have someone comment, Oh, well, look this guy fucking complaining. How hard is it? Because this guy acts like it costs so much. Exactly. Yeah. Well, continue, continue, sorry. The best is also in YouTube, like, doubles down on it. And they give you a 10 out of 10. And then there's like a line of copy that's like, your viewers have no interest in this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You try to achter their ass. They just, they just squeeze lemon on the wound. Yeah. Yeah. Have you considered being more interesting? Yeah. Yeah. Maybe quit. Yeah. I don't think YouTube's for you actually. Yeah. It's like five. It just has like a road. Yeah. Like three 10 out of 10s. I should have like a resume builder that pops up. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fill one of these out. Yeah. Try and maybe we thought we dug up your old LinkedIn profile. I mean scouted some careers. I might be able to do a video where you look for new jobs. Yeah. Yeah. Do you think that back to TMG studios like podcasting is a format for you guys\", 'Why podcasts?': \" investing in like not not suggesting building like a network of YouTube creators but building a network of podcasts and yeah. Podcasts has that held a little is that held a little bit more sacred than like the pace at which things are moving on YouTube and in social versus like Joe Rogan's been podcasting for how many years like is that is it a more stable creative environment that audiences are like yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But thanks. Yeah. I think this is something that again like we weren't super intentional about in the beginning it was like podcasts is working for us. Got it. It's really lucrative. So it would make sense for the for the first thing that the people do that we sign is to do a podcast because we know the world so well. Yeah. We already have these relationships where we can monetize it. So this makes sense. Right. Yeah. But now we're in this interesting place where it's like you know we're really good at making video podcasts. Yeah. It is it is somewhere where it feels like YouTube is moving more in that direction like you just see these for sure. Our long live streams from people where it's just a full on show. It seems like more and more of those are coming out and people enjoy watching those longer form video just unscripted. But now we're in an interesting place where like if that's the first move that we make and they're building an audience on their own then they can start to do kind of whatever like more short form YouTube videos. You know sketches if they want and we'll produce them. Yeah. So I think that's kind of an interesting future that we're sort of looking towards is is yeah we're signing podcasters but we're really signing creatives who really believe in and just giving them a platform to do whatever they want. Yeah. Outside of a podcast you know. You guys open and talking about like the terms of a deal when you bring a new creator in.\", 'Why TMG Studios is different than other networks': \" I always think it's interesting when like creators build a network because they have the perspective of what it would be like if they went in themselves. I mean these things that are important. It's tough to go into like a super niche detail. The thing is we actually kind of extrapolate parts of that to other people because we want to maintain the creative relationship with the people there. So we some of those conversations we do leave between like their people and our people kind of thing. I think the only thing we try to do is we do have aspects of the contracts or the agreements that we help build and we're really keen on just making people happy. Yeah. We because we've been on the other end where people offer us some pieces of deal and we're like it's like fuck you man like you don't even respect like what like me is a person building up what I've built and then bringing it to you. You know I'm not bringing it to you for you to just fucking cannibalize it and like ruin me. So yeah that's kind of been our motivation with like trying to you know build sets and create like a visual aspect that feels very you know like oh when you come here to do your show we like we care and there's going to be energy put into that. I think that's like the most important part of this next chapter of networks and media companies is that you guys have spent years and are continuing to spend years making the stuff like yeah it's highly unlikely that some of these the exact media executives at Quibi made short form content. So like even like executives at YouTube they don't make YouTube videos right so a lot of people who like when they were making decisions on YouTube originals like yeah they're just kind of they didn't know what works on YouTube because they never felt what it's like to be true film themselves and put it out like they don't know that experience. I think the empathy from a creative yeah for me if we're gonna sign with with anyone like I want it like when we got to sit down with the retineling you hear from them and you're like oh you know what this is like yeah that's true yeah you know way more what this is like than we know you know you've you've done this and I think that's a lot of the value when you look at young creators looking at TMG yeah it's like yeah they know they know what I feel like they know what it's like to press upload or to you know yeah there's that and like we also are really really keen on because you know not it's not to shade anybody but we see other podcast networks and their whole racket which is get as many people in here and pump them all to the same studio and let's see what sticks and I just think that's such a diss to the people who have built up what they built and you're just forcing them to you know oh yeah create this thing that you love in this extremely sanitized vanilla space that you can't affect your own none no this is great yeah it's like no no this is like there's not nothing the wall so no I mean to more like just sticking creators like onto like a table or like two chairs of the television and maybe I just thought your logo up there it's fine Yeah, you know, I think we like it's an assembly line. It's like I like that you call it like they like they we've never heard that term in a long time. Yeah, racket. Yeah, like a gangster movie. That's why they were new word. I love the idea of podcast network racket. Yeah, yeah. Everybody's a racket. So I think no, I mean, I'm a very I'm a very I tend to be very jaded about things. So when you zoom out like you mentioned that you know some of your day to day and the problems you're facing, you're trying to solve the problem in front of you, but trying to have that that zoomed out vision on where you headed. Where what is that? Like what is the zoomed out vision on where TMG studios is headed? I think I think we I think ultimately it's it's tough to say because we're\", 'The Future of TMG, Cody Ko and Noel': \" still experimenting. But I think the the ideal goal is that we have a roster of people that are just providing like really good entertainment and the the money that people are paying they feel it's the exchange is yeah is worth. I think and we want to enable them to to like yeah, you know reach their full potential. Yeah, and and do more like we can bring people on as podcasters, but if out of that they say hey, you know, is it possible to get some funding for this type of content or you know, we want to try these different avenues. We want to be in a position where we can green light stuff like that and just build like a nice ecosystem of just, you know, just creative people. I think that's but that's even like one to two years. Yeah, I think we're on our way to doing that. Yeah, hopefully I think five to ten years is like it would be really cool for us to be running, you know, a bigger scale media company where we're, you know, buying the rights to movies and making making those, you know, it's not just podcasts. I think podcasts are really great starting point. Yeah, I think we're going to take that really seriously. Yeah, for as long as we can, but I would love to scale outside of that niche and, you know, it would be cool to run like a full scale media company. Does that align with you guys creatively too? Like as TMG. Yeah, things like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, obviously there's been music. We're working on stuff right now. Yeah, cool. Yeah, yeah. That's not same vein. So that's really cool. Yeah,\", 'The TMG custom site': \" because I was curious about like, okay, you bring on another show like you guys are working really well as like you've built this model where you have a Patreon, but you guys actually like custom built this site and when it launched to be honest, I was like taking it back by it. Well, it's like, well, shut up. Fourth one. Yeah, yeah, yeah, those guys are really impressive. Yeah, they're impressive. Yeah, I mean, they're they're amazing. Yeah. When they reached out, you know, immediately the relationship around the bat was just like, I don't know, they were like just so generous. Yeah. Like they're like, hey, we, you know, and again, it was like it was like a creator first sort of mindset where he was like, I have, I know, you know, what you're looking for and we will build this site for you. You know, all you need to do is try to convert some people on. We were like, absolutely. We'll do that because it makes sense. Like it would just align with our vision. Like we wanted to end up in a place where we had multiple shows on one platform. Yeah, we could have done that on Patreon, but you know, it wouldn't have been branded. Yeah, I think that's the main thing. The way that they made down the weeds and create features that teams you studio.tv listeners really want. And I'm sure the best part about your new site is that you don't know fourth wall was involved. Yeah, that to me as a fan of you guys. I'm like, oh, I feel like I'm in my own space with you guys. To be fair, they they pretty much are because fourth wall is just kind of supplying like a code base, but like at the end of the day, we we have so much control over like, hey, can we add this feature and hey, can we enable this for people when they comment? And it's a very, you know, it's a great relationship because we get to give them good ideas. They get to give us good ideas. So in that way, I'm sure what we're developing for us isn't one to one with other people. And so it does end up feeling like this very personalized experience, which is really dope. It's cool. Yeah. Is the, and that was tmgstudio's.tv is the way I want to show it out or was that take that. That's Joel Park. Okay. It gets me every time. Is the is the immediate like next step for TMG more shows or is it like more creative with the current cast of of characters in the current world? Yeah. Yeah, that's the next step. Yeah. Should we stop there? Yeah. It's a it's a mixture. I do, you know, not because I sleep next to her, but I do have to quickly shout out my fiance, Alina. She's she's helped us at many stages, like kind of, you know, directly kind of through me or like in meetings with us, she'll kind of throw ideas out. She's been really helpful in the way of like, you know, sometimes I'll sit there and I'll the fuck me and Cody like need like a new type of concept. She has like a lot of production experience like she used to produce for Apple and so she's been really helpful in the way of like, oh, if you guys want to try this, I will produce it for you. And so that has been greatly helpful in figuring out, okay, what things do we do next? Like the thing we shot last week, I'm really stoked on that. Can we talk about it? Yeah, let's just talk about it. Let's do it. We're gonna. Yeah. It's gonna be so we're like, we're gonna do a moment house show and we essentially she helped like produce a fucking mashup of like survivor, the challenge and what else would it be? It'd be like a little bit of a, it's mostly those two, but I love the challenge. Yeah, yeah, yeah. She produced an original show. They used to be like a mix of these things. Yeah, because we like contestants. It's kind of because what it started with is Cody and I were like, we want to chew on something different, but we don't, we want to do it our way. And you know, so I was talking to her and she was like, well, you know, people like it when you guys interact, like, but they like it when you compete clearly because of all the Cody and well do stuff we do. And then she was like, uh, what if you did like a weird like challenge mashup? Because we watch a lot of the challenges, well, I'm like, oh, fucking, I know me and Cody would love that shit just because we're naturally a little bit competitive. Yeah. You know, we're a little bit, yeah, we try to be athletic. And then, I mean, this guy, 12 years experience, yeah, I don't want to sit on his, it isn't Olympian right here, dude, but Olympic hopeful. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hopefully the Olympics will realize what the fucking missed out on. Exactly. But yeah, so we shot that out last week and it was, I mean, that's some of the most fun we've had shooting in a minute. And it fully opened up this world where we were kind of like, dude, we could go to V2 against other people. We could make this a total shootout where it's me, Cody, and then four other people competing all against each other. I mean, there's so many ways you could slice it. And we did it all in our own studio. And it, go ahead. I was going to say, that's what's great about these moments of like kind of dry, like, what's next, what's next is that it leads to these moments where it's like, oh, fuck, it's like the ideas are, you know, running through your head. And it's like, we could, we should do five of these just us, but then we should also have other YouTubers in on this. And this could become this whole other thing. It's like, yeah, you know, that's, I love moments like that. You know, you're in a ebb and then all of a sudden you reach this flow state. Yeah. So I think that's like, in terms of next steps, I think that's really what dictates our next steps is we kind of draw on the resources around us. We like, we kind of start with our gut and we say, this is getting stale or we need to, you know, hey, we kind of need to refresh this idea that we've done in the past. Like, Cody and I will do is we love over like, maybe people want to see another version of us fucking around. That's kind of where it all stems from. That's cringles us fucking around. Cody and I will do is completely us like, you know, we're being told how to work out and we're not listening or pretending to break our fucking ankles, whatever. And then this now can be us like fucking with each other, but it's still entertaining. I mean, eventually host your own version of love island. Yeah. Oh, don't give me sorry. But no, no, no, no, they just don't just we've, we had a bit back in the day. We wanted to call it the influencer peninsula. And yeah, stick a bunch of them on. I've got it, whatever. But I think that's how we kind of, you know, that is how we dictate next steps because now that we have this great new concept that we can work on and build on, now we can say, okay, let's, we can build this into this show. And then it does well there. Okay, maybe let's extrapolate it or expand it and make it larger. Now we do it with, you know, other YouTubers or whoever, try to maybe draw some celebrity talent into it and make it bigger than us. I think it, it, I think a general theme is that everything we work on now is, I think we see a little bit more into the future. So unlike with that's cringe, we're kind of like, oh, let's just make a video. I think now we do think more in the realm of like, okay, if we do this, is it repeatable? Yeah. And how expansive can we make it? Sounds like you're thinking like, I'm meeting. I feel like this podcast was just like you guys going through a self discovery of recognizing you are now immediately executive. Kind of, yeah. Yeah, I'm definitely, I gotta buy a suit. Yeah. I'm definitely like reluctant to admit it sometimes. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's funny. Alina will have to tell me she's like, you and Cody are like doing a lot. I'm like, it's whatever. Yeah. Yeah. We're just, it's fine. Yeah. We just want to make great stuff. Yeah. Yeah. And we want to put people on. Like it feels good that like, you know, Ben and Emil and Connor and Brooke have this amazing platform now. Not that they didn't before. You know, obviously TikTok's awesome. But like, you know, they were able to give them this new format and the signature platform and, you know, let their minds run wild with whatever they want to do. You know, and we have some talent coming up that we're signing right now that we're really, really thrilled that they get those opportunities as well. Yeah. Bill, Bill, it feels good. It's really dope feeling. Yeah. I'm working with them. Yeah. Like it's great that, you know, we signed someone and then all of a sudden we're shooting a video for a moment house show or for Team G studios and we're like, we get to film a sketch for them, like the cult sketch that we did for Team G studios. Yeah. That was great. Yeah. That was, that was like a moment where I felt, like, I felt the universe. Yeah. Oh, this is talent as a part of TMG. And now every time we come up with an idea where we're like this game show thing, for example, or anything else, like a sketch or whatever, like for the moment house show, we had, you know, we were like, well, we need someone to come in and pretend they just got their arm eaten by a tiger and that person was Ben. Yeah. Because like anything that we do now, we're like, oh, let's, we have this talent. Yeah. Talent. Let's put them in and then it becomes something great. Yeah. Especially for people from TikTok, that's a huge service. Yeah. Because it's extremely difficult to go from TikTok to having anything long form. Yeah. And that's where you can sustain the business. Yeah. It's very true. I want to just shout out to, you know, we talked, I think this is the first time we, we've really like really delved into like the business. Yeah. So I just would be remiss if we didn't shut out everyone that works for. Yeah. It was also like was odd our representation. Yeah. You know, everyone, we have incredible teams and support systems around us, our fiancees. Definitely. So yeah, definitely wouldn't be where we are without them. And if you want to work for Team G Studios, you can email jobs at TeamG Studios.tv. Yeah. That'll be on the jobs at TeamG Studios.tv. And if you have a podcast idea that you want produced podcasts at TeamG Studios.tv. Well, on that note, like if people are, there's going to be people who are watching this who want to pitch you guys a podcast. Yeah. What makes a good podcast pitch for you guys? Does it have to be comedy? Like what's the problem? No, I think we were open to anything. Could it be like a multi-cultural duo who talks about like entrepreneurship and the yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Could it be. Yeah. Yeah. We we excel. We excel in one white guy and one ethnic leave a combo. We excel in that kind of\", 'How to work for Cody Ko \\\\u0026 Noel Miller': \" word. It's a good combo. Yeah. It presents a lot of opportunities. Yes. Yeah. It does. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You open up both sides. Yeah. There's the comfort of Colin and the exotic nature of me. Yeah. Yeah. And you're deemed safe next to Colin. Right. I've literally said that though before. Yeah. It's good that you're a paramount because I'm yeah. Yeah. That's it's harder. All right. If you're in an ethnically direct relationship. Yeah. But are there any other outside of that? I don't want to do a true crime show. Yeah. But like some funny angle on it. We have to be comedy but make it unique because there's so many true crime shows right now. Yeah. But I yeah, I really want to do that. That feels like just like a winning formula. How does like podcasting revenue break down? Like,\", 'How TMG Studios makes money': \" you know, between I guess membership, ad sense, brand deals, our brands of deals still part of that, like a significant part of that world. Like how do you guys look at that? Yeah. I mean, with the ad reads that we do, it's it's all I would say obviously are our subscribers. Those are the people that we really put at the front in terms of priorities because they're the ones listening every week. They're you know, paying every month. We want to make them happy. To what website? TMGStudios.tv. Okay. Got it. Yeah. Yeah. And which you know, you and you can learn more by just going to TMGStudios.tv. Right. About the service that we offer. And then you actually don't, you know, we'll do ad reads but those aren't you don't hear those on TMGStudios.tv. You know, that's just a completely, you know, the episodes are ad-free on TMGStudios.tv. Yes, they are. There's actually other ones. There's bonus content on TMGStudios.tv. Yeah. Yeah. Just surrounded by media executions. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Corporate America. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But, uh, yes, you know, those brand deals and then ad sense, we don't prioritize that or like we don't concern ourselves with it too much. Um, it is, it is important. Yeah. But, um, podcasts, podcasts-wise, we don't make that much ad sense. But when we do a code, you know, I'll do, we make decent ad sense money. Yeah. Not enough. Like they, they cost it, it costs a decent amount to produce those. So, usually with ad sense, we'll break even or make a little bit of money on ad sense if we do a code and we'll all do nowadays. Before we used to make a ton of money, but like they get less views now. So we kind of break even and then if we do a brand deal, that's when we, like in that video, that's where we actually profit. Yeah. We got it. Yeah. It's interesting. Do either of you guys like live in your YouTube studios or do you guys not really care about those? Like just check your analytics all the time. I check it pretty often. Check it often. Uh, I just try to remain sane. Yeah. So I, I had to delete it off my phone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was like, I don't, I don't need to know. Yeah. I just upload and I just either ask Alina or my production assistant, Alina manages a lot of my YouTube stuff. So I'm like, is it good? She's like, yes. And I just go, no more, no more. It's just us now. Yeah. Were there any like, oh,\", 'Partying with Elon Musk': \" shit moments collectively with you guys, whether it was a deal for a certain amount of money or like a milestone in your career, like a cultural moment, whether it was like on hot ones or something like that, any moment where you to like reflect back and it was just at the time, like a holy shit type of thing. I think the biggest those shit moments still was being an Elon Musk party house. Yeah. Yeah. That was like, yeah, actually, it was, yeah. Or when we like went and went to Europe with Post Malone, and yeah, recorded a podcast episode with them and went to like five of his shows, and then like that was a pretty wild, like few weeks. But yeah, when we were actually in the Elon Musk's house, yeah. And there was a moment like after we left where we were both like sitting on the curb, like children, like waiting for an Uber at 4 a.m. outside of Elon Musk's house. And we were just like, what the fuck just happened? How did you get invited to Elon Musk's house? One of Post Malone's high school friends introduced him to that's cringe. And then he just followed us on Twitter. And he just DM, he just DMed us. And then I was like, I appreciate the follow man. He just sent me his number. And he was like, let's hang out. I'm okay. So he put us in a thread. He was flying back from tour. He touches down in LA. We go meet him at a bar. We're hanging out. And then he goes, don't we go to Elon's? And we laugh. We're like, and he goes, yeah, let's go. And we're like, okay. He's like, I'm texting him right now. We're like, he just, he just turns his phone to us. Sure. Yeah. It's like it's true enough. It's like Elon Musk. And we're like, what? Oh, this is for real. You actually want to go to, he's like, yeah, let's go right now. Yeah. And yeah, we pulled up to his house and him and Grimes were standing on the driveway. Just like with lanterns. Yeah. Kind of checking out. Yeah. Yeah. That checks out. Yeah. That's super strange. Five. Yeah, it proceeded to be a very, very weird night. A P to one of the bathrooms. And I took a picture of me in the mirror. Like, I'm pissing in Elon's bathroom. You hung out for a minute. And then it got to a point where we were like, it's time to go. Yeah. Yeah. We go. It's like, where are you? We're at Elon Musk's house. It's hard to explain. Yeah. Yeah. And then before I am, we're waiting for an Uber just laughing. Like, what the fuck? Yeah. That's a wild moment. Weird. Really. I think you talked about Cody. Also like Jack Harlow at one point, starting to you and being like, like being a fan of the content. Is that, is that like more, did you talk about that? Yeah. I mean, we had, uh, texted because I've been a fan of his music for a long time. Yeah. Um, and so we somehow we like started, I don't even know how we like met or started talking initially. But I think I don't even know how, but we used to text and send DMs back and forth and stuff like that. And then, um, I did this like TikTok, like making fun of the one of the lines and his new song. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I got some echo chill and he was like, Oh, I mean, I saw that TikTok and I was like, Oh, fuck. Yeah. Is that cultural impact? They're like crazy that these like, I don't know, like, I think that's more, I think that's just a testament to the power of TikTok more than it is. Yeah. Our impact. You know, I think it's just like, if you make a TikTok about something, chances are, or somebody chances are they're going to fucking see it. He's got it. Everyone sees it. You know, yeah. I mean, um, it was cool when we went to Louisville. Uh, Jack put us in touch with like some of his childhood friends. Yeah. Yeah. That's where we're friends with his like immediate group of people. We have to talk to him in a, in a while. Yeah. That's a huge blue ace two for one. You know, uh, if you have to see this, um, yeah. Now they, uh, they, we hung out with them and, and uh, but yeah, Jack's been nice to us. Mm-hmm. He didn't follow either of us after you climbed them. So, okay. That's good. I think he actually thought it was funny because he was like, I thought that was funny. I was like, thanks. Yeah. He walked off with nine bodyguards. All right. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks.

Right. I mean, even the videos we did that were your most viewed videos could be way better. Right. What do you think gets us to a million subscribers? Well, subscribers is an arbitrary. Okay. So a million views. No, you should ask me what helps us make the best views possible. Okay. So you guys should ask me subscribers don't matter views don't matter. I mean, they do. Yeah. But all that comes, everything you want as a creator comes from making the best videos possible and thumbnails. But it's easier to, you know, make thumbnails. The video parts, the hard part and that's the thing that you're known for. No one's known for having no one's like the biggest YouTube in the world because they have the best thumbnails, right? It's also because they have great phenomenal content. You know what I mean? Like that's the hard part that very few people do well. And that's what people remember. You know what I mean? You're not going to have some random dude when you're walking down the street of Paris go like, yo, that's the guy with the great thumbnails. You know, they're going to be like, no, that's the guy with the phenomenal videos that whatever, you know, held his breath for 40 minutes underwater or things like that. So that's a tip for you guys. But also you guys watching ask how can I make my videos better? Do that every single day for years. And then you'll probably get views. I feel a lot like if we put out a video and we're frantically changing thumbnails afterwards, we're already way too far gone. Like, not that it doesn't help to change your packaging, but I know when we have a really good video. Like I know it's really good and the title and the thumbnail. If you want a video and you're not like, you're not like, this is a banger, this is going to bang no doubt in my mind. Even though you're going to be wrong 9% of the time, then it's not a good enough video. You still have to have that feeling even if you should have spent more time thinking about that. Like the audience tell you you're wrong. Don't put it out when you already know you're wrong. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. You know, because you have some videos you have in our fun. Well, if it's 10 out of 10, yeah, and it did worse than your other 9 videos. And it's like, okay, but you have videos you don't even upload sometimes. Definitely. I mean, you just, the thing is like, it's a lot harder for us because like what we're doing are big productions of those span of months, things get distorted. I visualize the giant amount of money and this and someone scooping it up in a tractor and then you do it. And it's not as epic. You're like, oh, this is kind of lame. You know what I mean? So it's just, I just watch it, honestly. And I just like, if there's ever a moment where I'm even slightly bored, I'm like, cut it. And if there's something where I'm not just like, wow, you know, like the whole time, then it's like, don't upload it. It's not good. And does it weigh on you at all that you're like, man, but we invested over 100 videos in my life. Like completely filmed. I've spent probably, I don't even want to pull number on it, but I'm godly about some money on videos in real life that don't get uploaded. I don't give a f***. Best video possible or get it out of my face. I don't care. What's the last video you did in Nuffload?\", \"MrBeast's hardest videos to make\": \" Well, this one is kind of on the fence. We're re-editing it. But if you never see it, then we did a video where we built like 10 sets and I built like 10 rep because of banks. It was robbed this bank. I'll give you $100,000. And then so like bank, vote number one, the boys had to break into the bank and whoever broke into the bank first got what was inside the vault's empty. And I'm like, so this vault's empty and some of the other vault's empty. But one of these vaults when you open it will get 100 grand. So they had to break into a bunch of banks and all of them were empty. And then after like nine ones, the tenth one, which they're like, none of these banks have the money in. They finally break in. I think I don't want to spoil it, but one of the boys broke in. And then they open it and there's $100,000 in cash. It's like, congratulations. You robbed the correct bank. And it's cool, but the sets were a little bland and the bits weren't as funny. And I didn't think it was as good as it could be. But hopefully, we're like on our twelfth at it. Hopefully this one maybe fixes some of the problems I'm having. What's the hardest video you've ever made, whether it came out on the channel or not? Oh boy. Oh, well, let's see. Oh God, Tariq, you have any inspiration throughout me? Yeah, I mean, I mean, team trees was, I mean, I enjoyed it, but that was, that was a ton, man. I mean, me and Mark Rover worked on that for like eight months leading up to it. I don't want to overestimate it. Maybe it was seven or six. And I was like, it started with me wanting to plant a million trees. And I was reaching out to all these YouTubers that do environmental stuff. And the gist was just like, you're crazy. You're like, this just isn't possible. You just can't plant a million trees. They're like, it takes like hours to plant like a hundred. And they're like, what are you thinking? And then I'm like, yo, Mark, can you build me something to plant trees? And like, some me and Mark are like scheming how to plant a million trees. And then I was closing it on 20 million subscribers. And I did like this thing where I gave my three-minute subscriber pennies, four-million subscribers like popcorn, five-million blah blah. And someone on Reddit was like, you should give your 20 million subscribers, or for 20 million subscribers you should plant 20 million trees. And I was like, Mark, I know a million is impossible, but get this. Let's plant 20 million trees to celebrate me hitting 20 million subscribers. And he's like, you're a f***ing idiot. And I was like, let's do it. And then we're like, you know, as we ran down the rabbit hole, we're like, there's no world where we're doing this. And then we're like, well, what if we gather all our fans? And we do like different events and plant them. And then we're like, nope, that would still only plant like 100,000. Like that won't work. And then we're like, like, okay, well, what if we pay people to do it? And then, or what if we do seed drives? What if we have our fans buy seeds? We sell seeds at cost. They buy it, they plant it in their yard, and then we do research for a month. And we're like, it's an innovation species. You could do more harm than good. I don't know if I trust 14-year-old Billy to understand whether or not they can plant that next to a pine tree. So then we're like, and we're going on for months on months. We're just figuring out how the hell we plant 20 million trees every week we're having calls. And then we, I don't remember how well we got connected with the Arbide Foundation. They've planted, like, I don't know the exact number, but I know it's over 100 million trees. They're experts. Like, this is what they do. And they're just like, yeah, we can plant a tree. They told us their cost and we were like, can you get it down to a dollar? And they're like, I mean, yeah, at scale, we could plant a tree for a dollar. And I was like, boom, there you go. And we were like, okay, all we need is $20 million and they can plant the 20 million trees for my 20 million subscribers. I'm already past 20 million subscribers at this point, but I'm like, fuck it. We're in too deep. And then now it's like, okay, how do we get 20 million dollars so we can plant 20 million trees? And then we just started figuring out slow again. It's like, there's so much stuff that never even made the internet like trick shot for trees. We were going to try to make a viral TikTok trend and get it where like you did a trick shot and if you missed, you had to donate $10 to plant 10 trees and then you had to challenge someone else like ripping off it. Yeah, less I spuck a challenge. And so we're developing this for like a month. And then we're like literally like testing it and then like I'm shooting a trick shot, donating trees. I'm challenging people like any fake videos and we're like roasting them. We're like, no, this isn't going to go viral. Like no one cares, right? And then we're just we're shopping all this. And then I don't know how we landed on it. And then we're just like, no, we're just going to get our audience to donate and we're just going to get every YouTuber we know to make videos on it. And we're going to just magically pray we don't only raise $500,000 and look like the biggest city at some planet. And so we somehow got a list. It wasn't from YouTubers. Like some company that does a lot of YouTube data, they sell to like media companies and they just gave us a list of like all the biggest YouTubers like on an Excel sheet. And Myanmar just like it took forever, man. We're just going down the list and I'd be like, do they follow you on Twitter? No. And we check our Instagram. We find some way to reach out to that creator or someone who follows us that follows them and we'll be like, hey, give us some contact. And we'd be like, hey, doing this thing. Make a video about trees, tell your fans every dollar they donate. Boom. And we went down this list, DMed over 1,000 of the biggest creators got hundreds of them to make videos on it. They all launched at the same time as our videos and like, and yeah, in the first day we raised millions of dollars and crushed our $20 million goal. The quote of the night is, all we needed was $20 million. That campaign wasn't the problem. That wasn't the problem. That is wild, man. There's so many, like literally it was six months to me just being in Mark. Mark more so than me. I'm of the kind of like, oh, let's do an intro, but Mark's like, every other day we'd have mental breakdowns where we're like, we're not going to raise $20 million. What are we crazy? We should do $2 million and I'd just be like, nah, let's do $20 million. I hit $20 million subscribers. Mark is a funny story. And then I would convince him. I'd be like, and also it's $20 million by 2020. It's a good slogan. And he's like, oh, well, if you put it that way, I guess we'll just keep you unrealistic goal. I mean, that was a big success though. That was huge. That was huge success. I mean, it is the biggest thing I've ever done. Yeah. I mean, literally not all 20 million have been planted. I think like 13, 12, 13, somewhere there has been planted. I think all of them, all 20 million will be planted by the end of next year. And yeah. I think that's a really good example of like, you make the best videos possible and then you can do anything. Like you do such interesting things. Exactly. You can plant 20 million trees. You could do that if you're making good videos. Yeah, but like, and the thing is like 99% of people even if you had that ideal, like, I mean, that was so much time, man. So much times and so many, like it started with a million. And it's like a half a year of just nonstop obsession and grinding and reaching out and learning and learning and learning and trick shot for trees and this and that all just culminating to that final end point. And like 99% of people would have gave up like they would have gone, I want to plant a million trees and someone would have gone, you could only plant a hundred and they would have been like, oh, well, it goes a good deal. You could do it. Do you think attention is the most valuable currency in the world? Well, of course. I mean, if you could post something in everyone in the world of watch that you'd be the most powerful man on earth. So of course. Simple question. Yeah. Just curious if you had that opinion. I do. Yeah. I have the same opinion. That's where that conversation ends. So what you did with Mark was really successful. Do you have plants that do something different with him? Yeah. And so a few days after the two-year anniversary of team trees or launching team sees, I don't want to give away too many spoilers. One dollar might get something out of the ocean. We'll reveal it then. But if you are a creator, which I know you guys have a lot of creators, so watch you. Hit me up or Mark Rover. Team sees is happening this year. We're going to try to raise more than 20 million dollars, which is terrifying. I need your help. I'm sick to my stomach thinking about it. You're going to raise one dollar for every grain of sand on the beach. Yes. Sure. That's the one. Team trees was definitely the biggest reaction that I remember. Yeah. Just global headlines everywhere. Elon Musk donated a million dollars. So we had this lead aboard. The more you donated, the higher up you got. So it would get like a ego match for people. So someone donated 100 grain and it'd be number one. And someone donated 101. And someone donated 200. And Elon Musk donated a million dollars to be number one, which I thought was cool. And then Toby from Shopify, which I love. Shout out to you. Super cool. Donate like a million and one dollars. So he took the swap from Elon and just sat up there. I thought that was funny. That's so good. I yo Toby, if you're watching this, when Tse's happens DM me, it'll be fun. We expect over a million dollars. We expect one million and two. Yeah. Even if you don't donate, it just be cool to get your thoughts on it. But over a million and two would be nice. So it was that we're doing just pure pressure. That's pure pressure. That every billionaire we write if you don't donate. I'm curious just if you, in terms of YouTube, I'm really curious your perspective on the vlogging format. Like creators like Emma Chamberlain. Like how do you think that plays into the concept of like she, I mean, her viewership is really significant. And sometimes she's just like at her house making coffee and making a peanut butter jelly sandwich. Like how do you think she captures that much attention? Well, I mean, it is entertaining. She's an actually funny person.\", 'MrBeast on Emma Chamberlain': \" And like that is a skill being, like I couldn't do that. Or if I did, like it wouldn't be so off the cuff. Like she, she's just an actually witty and funny person. Like Chris, in my videos, one of the wittiest people I've ever met in my life. Like you could just drop this gatorate bottle and he'd say something. I'd just make you laugh like crazy. And it's like, where did that come from? Right. But at the same time, you're limited by personality. Like she's doing well. She's, you know, top 1% of creators. But I mean, how many views a month? Like 40 or something? Like it's great. It's phenomenal. But it's like there's, she's tied down to her personality. If you don't like Emma, then you're not going to watch her videos. You know what I mean? And so there's only so big that can take you. And even if you do get super big, it's like literally just all on your shoulders. It's a lot of weight and a lot of pressure. So that is a lot of pressure. Because the product of the video is your personality. Well, yeah. Because if you're depressed or you're going through stuff, you know, it's harder to make videos, you know what I mean? But yeah, at the same time, like, you know, a lot of people just enjoy making that type of content. So yeah. That's true. Yeah. You need to be in a good mood to film a video. And you kind of say, you said, like, I don't really have a choice. Because if I don't, then I just burned half a million dollars. Yeah, on some videos here. But also your format lends itself that you don't always have to be in a good mood. Because like it's the story work that went in beforehand that ensures the reaction. Whereas like for Emma, she probably doesn't need to be in a good mood. Exactly. Like she does have to be in a good place for her personality. It's like two drastically different creators. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's almost like, do you try and take out a lot of those variables when you're planning a video? I don't know. I just do whatever I think will make the best video possible. I mean, I hate to always fall back on it, but that's the driver. It's just whatever I think will make the best video possible. Like if I thought telling people more about myself or being more personal and make the video better, I would do it. But I think most people, like for the most part, like they want to see me run for an FBI agent. They don't want Nick here. Me go, oh, also guys, tomorrow's my mom's birthday. You know what I mean? They're there to see me run from an FBI agent, you know what I mean? So.\", 'MrBeast on starting a podcast': \" But we did tweet about the Colorado podcast. Yeah. You replied to that tweet and you said, I'm starting a podcast. Yeah. There was a lot of people who are excited about that. They were like, people took it as a real headline. Yeah. There were some people who pressed out list that said, Mr. Beast announced his podcast. I mean, the only reason I would do a podcast is to make money to do big YouTube videos. So if I thought that I could make enough or make a difference, I'd be able to album my content. But it's just like that. It's happy. Study big YouTubers. It happens time and time and time again. They like, they get big. They start side projects. They lose focus. Their channel falls off and then all that stuff fades away with it. You know what I mean? You just got to be focused at the end of the day. That's what matters. Main channel, Mr. Beast and all this other stuff supports it. You know what I mean? Uh, right now when you download the YouTube app, your picture is on there. Yeah. Like you are on the Google Play Store. On a Play Store Apple Store. On the Google Play Store when you download YouTube, your picture is on there. How much do you interact with YouTube? Do you give them advice on YouTube? Not really. No. Do they reach out to you at all? I mean, at the end of the day, like, what am I going to tell? There are army of 100 people or 1000 people that work on this part of the thing that like, yeah, my five second thought of opinions better than their analysis. You know what I mean? No, I think they do a good job. I think they take responsibility. And I just, it's crazy that you, if you have 100 subscribers, you have five. If you upload a good enough video, it will get views. Like if you're not, you're just, I don't want to make such a definitive thing. Take this to the grand side. I don't, majority of the time, you're just not making a good enough video if it's not getting views. You know what I mean? If that's your goal to get views, obviously if your goal is not to give views, then who cares? You know what I mean? But you can get a million views on a video, even if you have 100 subscribers, if the video is good enough. You can. Promise. I've seen it happen a bunch. Next to YouTube, right under it, is there a platform that you like the most? Next to YouTube? No, I mean, I like them, but it's YouTube. YouTube is what I live and breathe. Take them all away. I don't care. I just want YouTube. YouTube is the future, in my opinion. I have television. It's the biggest. It's not going anywhere. It's the most dominant. And I just, I love YouTube more than anything. Why do you think it's so dominant? Like what makes YouTube? I told you, like Android. You know, come on Android phones. Google and it's just has such a deep catalog and there's so many people on it, has the best monetization program. Like, you know, YouTube's paid creators more than any other platform in history. You know, probably more than the other platforms combined. You know what I mean? And it's just, I love it. I love it so much. I don't know. I think the algorithm also promotes better storytelling. Like the barrier to entry of the title and the thumbnail. If you actually back up that title and thumbnail, it requires that you told a compelling story. I agree. And then when it comes down to retention, if you actually keep someone from zero to fifteen minutes, you've done a good job of telling a story. My problem when I load up YouTube on my TV is that there's too many videos I want to watch. It's gotten too good at recommending me videos that I see like foreign the top row and like the top, you know, top half of like another four. And I'm just like, I want to watch all of these. What do I do? What type of videos are those? Like, you know, probably be like how a US aircraft carrier gets food and I heard delivers mail, you know, air flight patterns of planes. And then this one will be like, how this random guy on Reddit turned $1,000 into a million and stuff like that. And then there's like the random like what Aristotle taught people in 10,000 years, whatever it goes, stuff like that. But yeah, it's always like, they're always so interesting and I know like, like, I'm going to watch most of these videos because I've watched thousands of videos on my account. So it's like, it knows what I'm going to watch and it's just like, it's so hard at this point for me. I don't know if other people have this problem. Like the algorithm's getting so good that I think they need to serve less videos because I don't, I'd stress me out. I'm like, which one do I pick? I want to watch them all. Is there an analytic that you wish you had?\", 'Analytics with MrBeast': \" The I would love to be able to see what a bunch. Which one do I say? That's horrible. I would love A8 to be able to do A, B testing, that's I think we all agree. Like that one I don't even know that would be second. I'd love to see like if someone, if someone watches selling houses for a dollar, right, they watch this video, they watch all the way into the end and I would love to be able to see like if they win and watch another video and another one, right? Or a better example would be like, like it did last sleep circle for 10 grand, right? I'd love to be able to see, okay, well, a lot of people who watch this when, then win and watch like last sleep slime and then actually you can see that. I just wish, I don't know, like, which there's this an easier way to show it. Like you follow because of your cards. You mean? Well, you can click on a video suggesting C which we will suggest it. I guess, yeah, I guess I'm just too lazy to dig through that. It just be cool to be able to see the viewing patterns of, but the more I'm speaking at the more I'm realizing there would probably be privacy concerns. Yeah. If you could follow a user. So, yeah. So, now I'm going to start back, like maybe that is. But you mean like an aggregate, like if it's said like, but it does kind of show you that. Yeah. Yeah. I guess I'm an idiot and that just disregard everything I just said there. The more I think about the dumber that was. So, there was a couple things on your financial statements that I found really interesting. Yeah. We're back in that. Yeah. Yeah. So, you loved the financial statements. Yeah. I loved it. That was my favorite. They're fun to talk about because no one's ever seen them before. Yeah. So, one of the parts of your financial statement was also merchandise. And I feel like it's not something we hear about that often with you. Unless it's like you're writing everyone's name on the wall. Yeah. How do you interact with that? Or does it interest you? I saw that it's like available in retailers. Yeah. We're in zoomies and that's going well. I don't know. I'm so obsessed with making the best feels possible. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, it's like I could make, I mean, ungodly amounts of money if I promote a merch every video, but I just don't want it. I just want to make the best feels possible. You know, so yeah, it's, it's not what it could be basically fraction of what it could be. If I should make most videos, I don't even mention merch. Imagine if I promote a merch every single video. You know what I mean? Yeah. I would sell a bunch, but I don't know. I just want to make the best feels possible. And I don't think promoting merch makes the video better. Sometimes they, but let me back put a little bit. Sometimes they do need to promote it because some videos cost over a million dollars and I don't do a million dollars per video and ad revenue. So, you know, yeah. All right. So, we did a YouTube money calculator to see how much money your channel has made in total and it's lifetime. Okay. Lifetime. Lifetime. Okay. The main channel. Okay. And so, that's often 12 billion views. 12 billion views. Okay. So, the number it gave us was 28 million dollars. So, it's assuming like a $2.3 RPM. Interesting. I mean, obviously I've spent tens of millions of dollars on my videos. So, the money has to come from somewhere. I won't leave it at that. You know what I mean? Okay. Yeah. Because you've spent more than that. Of course.\", 'MrBeast on spending a billion dollars': \" Yeah. I mean, tens of millions of dollars have gone into my YouTube videos. Like, because I've taken all the money from the gaming channel, the React channel, all the other stuff I'm doing on my merch, all the brand deals, everything. Gone right back into it. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, there's probably going to be a day where I'll spend over a billion dollars on just YouTube videos in the future. That's so crazy. Obviously, I'm nowhere near that. But I'm talking like, you know, two decades from now or a decade, yeah. Yeah. But in a year, you're spending lots more than I just said. Yeah. Way more funny than I said. I mean, like, some months first feel like four or five million dollars on videos, yeah. Yeah. So, crazy. I saw it in the financial system. Yeah. Yeah. That's a shock to you. Try lighting a soccer field or something, right? You kind of, like, I'm renting an NFL stadium. Yeah. Or any of that type of stuff. It's expensive. But, but alone, pay us videos. Yeah. As team guys. I don't want to get into that, man. It just, how many people work here? I don't know at the exact number. You know, because, you know, some people hire and I'll leave it a lot of, but I mean, it's a lot. Obviously, dozens of fun, dozens of people. I'll leave it open for interpretation. You guys speculate. Yeah. But, do you ever feel, you talked about like people always suggested that maybe you\", 'Does MrBeast get burnt out?': \" would get burnt out on YouTube? Do you ever feel burnt out like other times where you feel like tired? My definition might be different than others. You know, like, some people are like, I'm burnt out, screw this. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. You know, like, never, never at that point. But, yeah, like if, if I'm going like, you know, I go from time to get up to time, I go to bed like three days in a row, I'll be like, okay, like, kind of want to like take half a day off and like chill or like, I'll feel like coming and stuff like that. But, this is what I'm doing to the day I die. I don't care. Like, I love this more than anything. Nothing's ever brought me a fraction of the joy. What are the in between moments like for you when you're like buried alive for 50 hours? Like, because we don't see all of it. Well, you do. In between these things, we show time lapse, so you could see I was in there the whole time. But, I mean, yeah, still, you don't see your reaction. I don't see if you're enjoying it in the middle of it. I'll just point you to enjoy it. Here, let me just put this out there. I did not enjoy being buried alive. So we're all on the same page. My back hurt from laying on a wooden board for 50 hours. The thing is like, you know, sometimes I got a little claustrophobic and I'd be like,\", 'MrBeast on being buried alive': \" oh, God, I can't stand up if I wanted to. But I'd just be like, you know, we did our research. We tested it. We buried the box for like, you know, what was it? I tricked, you know, I don't care. Like five, ten days beforehand. Like, we did extensive research. So every time I'd be like, oh, God, I can't move. There's thousands of pounds of dirt on me. I could die. I'm like, nope, did the research trust math? I'm not gonna die. You know what I mean? I had to just remind myself multiple times. Like, nope, you're good. Because it was a see-through coffin. So it's different than just a normal one. Every time I look up, I just see dirt. And it's like just the only thing stopping that dirt from just suffocating me and collapsing on me is just this glass like this thick, you know? That's the only thing staying between me and whatever, like eight feet of dirt. So we were in one of your meetings yesterday. And it's for when you are coming videos. And they brought up that there are boa constrictors. And that boa constrictors were a real threat to this production to you. And that, you know, while they're not poisonous, they can crush your body in a matter of, you know, minutes. Yeah, exactly. So we'll keep the medic within a minute. So the discussion was around where the medic should be. How many medics we should have? Yeah, we're putting two medics stations. So they're close enough that they can stop me from getting killed by a boa constrictor. So have you developed an appetite for pain, for managing fear and discomfort? Well, I mean, we just a strategic. Like we don't ever do anything where I could die. Like, barely alive. There was a zero-present chance to anything would happen to me. Like we did our research, we hired consultants. We spent over a quarter of a million dollars spending that company. Like, there was no risk. I was probably safer down there than I was up above the ground. And like, genuinely, I mean that. I was safer in that box than if driving the car home afterwards. If you really think about it, just like when they say you're safer in a plane than you are driving a car. And so, you know, it's like, we don't leave anything up to chance. We're very tactical and we account for all that stuff. But like, opportunity to die is one thing that like, just discomfort, like feeling. Oh, with discomfort. Oh, with discomfort. Feeling claustrophobic. Getting really, really sunburned. It's weird. Like, when I count to 100,000 or even before that, I cut a table and half with plastic knives, which took, God knows, like, days. I'm just soling. Because I was in math class when I was in high school and I just like, I'd plastic knife in my pocket from lunch. I don't know why I put it there. And I just like, saw it a little bit. I was like, oh, well, you can cut a table and half, like on my desk. You can cut a table half with plastic knives and then, I just threw it away. And later that day, I was like, wait a minute. And then I just like, I ran to the store late at night and my mom's like, what the fuck are you doing? I'm like, just buying knives. She didn't know I was a YouTuber, like doing videos back then. And then I had no money or anything. But I just bought like $5 worth of plastic knives and I just grabbed one of our tables. So I just started cutting it. And I hit record and I was like, hey, guys, I'm going to cut this table and half of plastic knives. And then it's just like, I thought it takes like four hours, but like a dozen go by. I'm not even half way done. And I'm just like, cutting a table and half of plastic knives. I don't know why. It was so dumb. I think if I was your mom and I was watching a video of you watching paint dry, I'd be like, what is Jimmy doing? I know. I know. I know. I'm taking him on the back end of counting to a hundred thousand. Right. I right after I dropped out of college and had to move out. Good times. Yeah. He thought it was going crazy.\", 'Why MrBeast dropped out of college': \" Wait, so you dropped out of college and then you moved out of your, well, have we talked about that? I don't know. I don't know. We'll talk about college. Yeah. So I didn't want to go college. I don't care. You should. I'm not saying it's bad blah, blah, but for me, I hate, I hate school. I hate it. I hate it. I just want to make YouTube videos. It's all I ever want to do. That's all I ever wanted to do. But I didn't have the best grades in school. They didn't really have a job. I wasn't making enough after I graduated high school. So my mom was just like, either you go to college or you move out. Like you're not going to live here and not go to college or whatever. She wants what's best for me. She's not her being mean. It's like, obviously she didn't think this magical YouTube thing would work out. So she's like, you got to have some type of future. You can't just bet it all on the internet forever till you die. And yeah, so I just, I need to say the story in a way where it doesn't make my mom sound mean because she did it because she loves me. But so I go to college, just community college. It's not that expensive, whatever. And I just couldn't stand it, man. It made me just so depressed. I just, I hate it. I hate it. So I just want to be a YouTuber. That's it. And so after two weeks, literally just two weeks, I just stopped going. But I didn't have enough money to move out. That wasn't making anything. So I just didn't tell my mom. And I would act like it was going to college. And then I would just sit in my car in the college campus and just work on videos or edit or just work on a script or something and then I'd come home and I'd be like, hey, mom, college is great. And then I'd keep working and that can't last for that long. Yeah. No. Thankfully, I don't remember what happened. I remember sitting in like on the stairs in front of one of the college classrooms. I was like talking to James, one of the people you met and I was like, yo, I don't know what the fuck's going on, but like I've been just been grinding, grinding every hour of the day. And I just made like 20 grand a month. I was like, I'm ready to like tell mom that I'm failing every class and I move out tomorrow. He's like, okay. And I just I picture that because it's like 11 p.m. and I'm just pacing and then I'm like, yeah, mom, I'm I'm I have zeros and everything. I haven't been going. I was like, I'll move out tomorrow. And then I moved out the next day and she was so mad. But I was starting to finally make money. And so I could afford to move out. And there you go. How much longer after it was that your mom started working with you? Probably than a year after that. Yeah. And then I quickly got to the point where I was making her whole salary every month and it was like, why are you working? And people thought I was dumb. The first thing I did was retired my mom and people were like, why would you do that? You should see what he for yourself. And I was like, I love my mom. She's great. I'm actually the best mom of the planet. Like your mom's second. But yeah, I put her through a lot with poor grades, poor everything. Like, I mean, in a world where like, you know, I feel college and nothing comes out of this YouTube thing. It's just funny. I think what I could tell from meeting your mom was that your mom loves like the story of you becoming who you are today. She loves it so much. You know around all the other studios and offices and there's really like, there's no photos of you on the wall for the most part. There's no like pictures from videos, screenshots. There's a lot of play buttons. I'll say that. Sure, they're playing a clip of it. There's a lot of play buttons. But it wasn't until we went to the office where your mom works, where we walk in and it's like a Mr. Beast Mucino. And I was like, okay. So she's the one who's nostalgic about this entire journey. Yeah, because I met before I did that thing like two weeks into college. I was like, I was like trying to go shit with my mom. I was like, here's the deal. I'll go to college if you do all my homework. You do all the homework. No, I was like, I can't do this. I was like, I have to make videos. This makes me sad. This makes me happy. And she's like, this doesn't make money. This will make money. And I'm like, but this makes me happy. And she's like, no. And that's, I forgot that part. That's when I stopped going. My mom wouldn't agree to do all my homework. There's another funny story is, and I don't know why so early in the semester we had this, but we had to pair up with random people to do a project. And I had a partner and I just never came back. And I've completely forgot about it, but we were supposed to be working on something. And like, three months later, he messaged me. No, three months, all right, jump. Two weeks later, he was like, yo, we still doing this. And I was like, I'm never coming back to college. And he's like, so do I tell the professor? And then he messaged me like two months later. He was like, oh, yeah, they ended up going easy on me because my partner laughed. And he called me and told me about it. And it was like the writing bit in the class. We got a project together assigned and then I just never came back. And he just left with the whole thing and everyone else had a partner. You may have gotten him a better grade through sympathy. Exactly. That's what he said. And so I'm glad it worked out for him, but it was funny. I felt so bad. It's funny. Your mom told us that story too about how when you started making more than her paycheck every month, like that's when she was like, oh, wow. Which was a big deal for us. We didn't have any money. Yeah. Like again, I don't want to over-dramatisize it, but we really didn't have much. I was like, second I could. She didn't have to work twice on Wednesdays and maybe could take a little bit of time off. And she could actually breathe for the first time in her life and stuff like that. How did she see that? Where was that money coming from? From AdSense or from Brandeels or from everything? I don't know if I know at this point. I wasn't selling merch. Yeah. I mean, I was probably doing Brandeels for... No, I didn't even do my first Brand deal until I moved out. Because the 10K Brandeels, my first one, and that was when I was living at my new house. So that was after I dropped out. So yeah, I was probably doing like 20, 30 grand a month in Ad revenue. So whoever gave you that first 10K Brand deal got a lot of bank for their buck. I don't from Quid. Got it. Yeah. Which he works at current now and he's really smart. Oh, that's cool. He's still worked together to this day. It's funny. Oh, that's crazy. He does many other companies. Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah. Yeah, you've had a lot of long-term relationships with these companies. Because I'm not going anywhere. Yeah. I'm going to be here in 10 years. Yeah, that's interesting. Like with Honey and with Current. That's current. Now it sounds like it's even longer term without them. That's cool. Yeah, exactly. I mean, hiring Adam is cheat codes for your company because he just knows so many creators. And like, if he was to set some company that's doing like a million dollars a year in revenue or whatever, I'd still probably work with them just because I like the dude. You know what I mean? Yeah. Kind of funny. So this space now, this is now the official like biggest single investment you've made.\", \"MrBeast's $10 million studio\": \" Oh, of course. By 20 billion fold. See how it is. Because we like you guys are only seeing the inside of this space, but there's also a lot of space around it. Yeah. I don't even want to go to and depth. Sure. More acres than you could ever need. We're going to build 20,000 square feet of office. We're going to build a replica of this. I mean, the problem is like I talked about before. If you, you know, we have multiple warehouses, but if you, since the videos take months to do, and you know, and I want to upload it, and I do a world for a month. So any videos take 90 days to do, you know what I mean? That's 12 videos that in the next 90 days you got to do. And if you're not working on them now, then they won't happen in 90 days. And so it's the bottlenecks space, you know what I mean? Like I've told you guys this a million times, this is for you guys. If one video is taking up all of our studio, well, we have 11 other videos to work on, they can't happen till that. And so we just need tons of space to be able to work on videos months in advance because if we don't, they don't happen, you know what I mean? Do you think would be like a dream collaboration or a dream video to do out of here? Do you have something like that? Oh, a dream collaboration or dream video. Not dream, but dreaming. Yeah, like dream. No dream, dream. There you go. Yeah, I mean, if he did a face reveal, he would be like me get the cloud for that. But if he did like, and one of our videos, he just simple was mass. That would be, how are we having? Yeah. Just all of them. I pick whatever I want, the craft, the ultra viral video. It'd be like corpse and dream and all these people lined up. And it's just like the one after another, just take the mask off. Guaranteed 200 million views. I know when we were playing basketball last night, Sapnap was like, yeah, live with dream. I was like, oh, wow. So you've seen the base. Yeah, you want to sketch it out for us? Asking you or do I, is it doing on-ass? I don't know. What do I do? What color is the size? Yeah, that was funny. Yeah, that would be a very viral video. Yeah, that would be wild. Of course, obviously that would help. You just don't need all this space for that. That's true. Or maybe you do. Maybe you do it in a way where you do need it in space. My dream is uploading consistently, which that is a bigger thing. We're all like, some months, I don't even upload videos, some months, we upload four videos, some months, we upload one. It's just like, what does consistently mean for you? Is that once a week or is that? Or are you just saying anything? Right now I just want to upload once a week. But long term in the future, like three plus years from now, I'd love to get to the point where we're doing two original, giant, spectacles, never wore, seemed better than everyone else. Fucking huge, ginormous, best video in the **** in world videos twice a week. Do you think that any of your other videos, sorry, do you think any of the other channels will pass your main channel? No, no, no. You don't think so. I mean, even like four in language, even like India, like could India, the Hindi one. Could that pass the main one? Audience wise, more people could watch it, but I doubt it would pass the main, just because it's dubbed. It will get up there though, a large percentage. It's like, that's fun, you'll channel, and I'm sure you're showing it as we're doing this. It's getting two plus million views per video. And, you know what I mean? It's the same videos, it's dubbed, you know what I mean? So, which is that already as wild for dub content. Totally. But it's like this, it's actually a classic strategy in every other type of entertainment or whatever. Or a huge fan of anime. And like, I saw this one video of Naruto where they like compare a really emotional scene in like 10 different languages. And it's just fun. I mean, when I used to go to India when I was a kid, I would watch friends in Hindi, like, really? You know, it would sit there, yeah. Do you speak Hindi? I understand it fluently, I don't speak it. So, here are sentences in Hindi? Sure. Yeah. Come on. Yeah. And the must-see, up case, I know.\", 'Samir speaks hindi': \" Interesting. Okay. That means, hi, how are you doing? Tariq, you want to talk in Arabic? Let's do it all. What's that word you always say? Oh, baby. Oh, baby. Yeah. I'm a friend or a salamu alaikum alaikum, it's like, peace be upon you. It's calming just to hear people talking about it. It is. Yeah. I don't know why. They're watching to learn more about YouTube, they're taking notes. So, I'm just like, hey, Tariq, talk in Arabic. And they're like, okay, cameraman talks in Arabic. Comedian, cameraman speaks Arabic. Okay, we got the word though. It's interesting, like, if you don't know what someone else is saying, it's a different language, you can sort of like surrender the fact that you need to understand. Exactly. You need to pay attention to comprehend. You're just listening as I can. I kind of get that. You know? Yeah. I just get to enjoy that. Yeah, just sit there and lullaby. Yeah. But that's why visual storytelling is so important. It's just stuff that doesn't need language. That's like the stuff that I at least I've seen goes to most of our work. And I know we've been going on for a while, but now it is the time to hit us the most important question because you're re-hoking the viewers. You're telling them this video is not over. What's the big question to keep them watching? Last time you were on our channel, you told everyone that if they subscribed, you would pick one of them and give away $1,000. Or actually. No, you guys would get out. You're telling that we would give away $1,000? Did you do it? Yeah, we did it. We did it. We did it. No, no, we didn't. We filmed it, too. Yes.\", 'Giveaway': \" My question now for you is, if people are watching this video and they subscribe, how much money do they... They get? If either we give it or you give it. How much money do we give? Okay. How about this? If you subscribe, not you, but one random person that does, I'll give you a few questions. I'll give you this Gatorade bottle. I'm going to give it to you. Okay. And they'll give you $500. Okay. Deal. You can get this... Unopened. Actually not open. Let me make it less valuable for you. Okay. Here, we'll just drink a sip. Clip this. Sell this on eBay with this clip. Someone pay $500 for this. We are literally going to take this. So if you subscribe to the channel, you can win this and you can win a $500. There you go. We'll pick one random person. All you have to do is hit that subscribe button. It's closing in on a million subscribers. The second they just start getting 70% retention on a video. We're closing in the second they do the things I tell them to do. Yeah. All right. I can't wait to find out who gets this. Whoever gets it, don't drink it. Damn it. Watch this. It's like NFT. Yeah. That's going to get NFT. Cool. Okay. Cool. I'm happy with it. That was awesome. Yeah.

      "[{'Who is Dream?': \" There's three reasons why Dream is so successful, and the first is that he's a purple cow. But we're gonna get into that later. If you don't know who Dream is, over the past three years, he became one of the most famous people on the internet. How do Dream? Dream is here! Oh my god, it's Dream! But no one knew what he looked like, not even his closest friends. I have never seen his face before. No joke. So when Dream actually took off his mask and revealed his face, that took over the internet, and over 38 million people have actually watched that video of him taking off his mask. We're gonna be breaking down the three tactics that Dream used to explode on YouTube. And whether or not you're a Minecraft streamer or you're even familiar with him, these tactics can be super helpful for you as a creative. Also, according to YouTube statistics, only a small percentage of people that watch our videos are actually subscribed. So if you end up enjoying this video, consider subscribing. It's free, and you can always unsubscribe. Alright, so this is a text that I got last week from my sister-in-law, Lauren. She said, I don't understand Dream. This week, you'll have to explain it to me, I'm so old. That's probably a sentiment a lot of people had when Dream completely took over the internet with his face reveal. So who is Dream? So Dream, if you're unfamiliar with him, he's a Minecraft streamer, he streams himself playing Minecraft on his YouTube channel, and he quickly stuck out from the rest of the streamers who were playing Minecraft. Because it is a very large community. Now, yeah, Minecraft is one of the most popular games, and if not the most popular game in the world, and Minecraft videos are an incredibly popular genre of YouTube video. So it's almost a question of, well, if you're going to make Minecraft videos, what's the difference? And Dream actually did something really different. Yeah, so he is a developer and a coder, and he was able to create situations in worlds within Minecraft that no one had ever seen before. So Minecraft, but gravity flips upside down every minute. And that's actually the first tactic that we recognize that Dream used to build this massive audience. And that tactic is to be a purple cow.\", 'Why Dream is a Purple Cow': \" Excuse me? That might sound strange. Should we have Seth explain it to them? Yeah. So Seth Goedin, who's a marketer and a writer, has this concept of the purple cow and is a marketing concept, but it really applies to what Dream did to grow on YouTube. Consumers don't care about you at all. They just don't care. Part of the reason is they got way more choices than they used to and way less time. And in a world where we have too many choices and too little time, the obvious thing to do is just ignore stuff. And my parable here is you're driving down the road and you see a cow and you keep driving. Because you've seen cows before. Cows are invisible. Cows are boring. Who's going to stop and pull over and say, oh, look, a cow. Nobody. The cow was purple. You notice it. The thing that's going to decide what gets talked about, what gets done, what gets changed, what gets purchased, what gets built, is it remarkable? And remarkable is a really cool word. Because we think it just means neat. But it also means worth making a remark about. And I think no matter what type of crater you are right now, most likely you're facing a lot of competition. And it's really hard to stand out, but that's actually what you should prioritize. How can you be not necessarily better but different? I mean, you can see by the quality of this TED Talk that this concept from Seth Godin is old. It's timeless. The concept of being remarkable, the concept of standing out, the concept that consumers don't have a lot of time, that is a concept that existed pre-youtube. And what Dream really did was say, okay, if there's this many Minecraft videos, you know, Minecraft, but gravity is flipped every minute, all of a sudden that's the purple cow. This video, we coded it, so that at random times, the gravity flips upside down. Our goal is to beat the game. These are things that other Minecraft streamers couldn't necessarily do because they weren't coders. Not only are you gonna click on that and watch it, but he's actually giving you the sentence that you can go say to another friend. So, hey, did you see that video where lava is falling from the sky? So, I think you have to, as a creator, think about the remark that someone is going to make about your video because at the end of the day, the way ideas spread, the way that video spread, is actually through word of mouth. When we interviewed Mr. Beast, what was remarkable about it was that it was the only interview with Mr. Beast for the most part. Now, he went on a podcast tour, there's a lot. So, you have to try and find that area where you can stand out. You look at Andrew Schultz, their episode. It was four hours long. That's remarkable. Have you seen the episode with Mr. Beast that's four hours long? It's true. So, there's always ways to sort of iterate and maintain that purple cow essence. So, be a purple cow. Yeah. By the way, Colin, we got this package from Dream. Mm-hmm. We bought the package. I don't want to make it sound like he sent it to us. We purchased it. Just a wake-cooler when he was. Yeah. Okay, I'll go back to that. We got this package from Dream. And we don't know what's inside of this, but we are going to open it at the end of this episode. Thanks, Dream. So, the other thing that makes him remarkable is the fact that he's faceless. I mean, that's obvious, right? Your favorite streamers, your favorite gamers, you had some sense of what they looked like, you could develop relationships with them, could develop emotions and attach them to this face. But Dream being faceless was another one of those things where it's like, he's a Minecraft creator and he doesn't have a face. Or he's got a blob as a face, smiley blob. I think what's really interesting about Dream is that it was accidental. It was not deliberately written into his plan that he would be faceless. He really says it's a product of the pandemic. That's just when he started to take off was 2020. And everyone already was wearing masks. And if you're a Minecraft streamer, you don't have to show your face. And it just started to become a thing. He didn't choose his face as his avatar. He chose this logo. And then started to realize, oh wait, this is adding a layer of intrigue for my audience.\", 'Why Dream is a Mystery Box': \" And the fact that Dream was faceless for so long is tactic number two, which is have a mystery box. That probably makes no sense right now, but we are gonna play this clip from director JJ Abrams that we'll explain it. Tannen's mystery magic box. I bought this decades ago and I'm not kidding. If you look at this, you'll see it's never been opened. Now I was looking at this was in my office and as it always is on the shelf and I was thinking, why have I not opened this? And I realized that I haven't opened it because it represents something important. Infinite possibility. It represents hope. It represents potential. The withholding and information, doing that intentionally, is much more engaging. Whether it's like the shark and jaws. If Spielberg's mechanical shark bruise had worked, it would not have been remotely as scary. He would have seen it too much. In Alien, they never really show the Alien terrifying. Even in a movie like The Graduate. They're having that date, remember, they're in the car and it's loud and so they put the top up. You don't hear anything they're saying. You can't hear a word, but it's the most romantic date ever and you love it because you don't hear it. I love the premise that the shark and jaws is scarier because you never see the shark. And when you say it's scarier, it's actually that the audience has interpreted it to be scarier. It implies a level of work that the audience has to do to enjoy the story. And that's kind of what Dream did. There was all this mystique and conversation around who is he? Not knowing what Dream looked like created this mystery box for the entire audience that they got to fill in themselves and they got to interpret who Dream was and almost even place their own experience into this person. And that's all of a sudden developing a deeper relationship because your mind is connecting the dots. Another really great example in the office. Yes. And Ham takes off her mic to go hug Michael on Michael's last episode. I mean, the fact that you can't hear their last conversation makes it that much better. It becomes as powerful as you want that moment to be. Not as powerful as maybe the writers were going to write it. I also think that as the face reveal started to get closer and closer, he facetimed creators. And he had them film their own reactions where they're looking at their phone and then he calls them, they're reaction to seeing his face for the first time. So all of a sudden, you have this unclosed loop, right? Which is what does this guy look like? You don't know. And your curiosity is killing you for two years plus. And then as the moment's getting closer and closer, he's closing that loop, but not all the way to build the anticipation. And the mystery box is slowly opening, right? So you're peaking in a little bit to other people's reactions to seeing what's in the mystery box. That's such good marketing. Yeah, and I think as a creator, what you should be thinking about is how can you use omission as a storytelling tool? Right. How can you sometimes not give the audience everything? Like this. We don't know what's in this bag, right? But it came directly from Dream himself. That's right. And if someone was here right now, they opened it, looked at it, and had a reaction, that actually makes it even more interesting.\", 'Why Dream took off his mask': \" So now I think it's interesting to think about the fact that by omitting his face, that was what brought him a lot of success. Now he decides to reveal his true identity. Was that the right move, right? You know, there's a couple of reasons that he states why he did this. Number one, he mentioned he felt like there wasn't much else he could do in Minecraft. Like he had already kind of done everything that he could do. Let alone the Dream SMP, which we have not even touched on. Right. It wasn't that he was just making unique situations. He also had a server that became a world for live storytelling, again, something that was unique to Minecraft at the time. Listen. And then created all of these characters that became incredibly famous. I'm just saying, I do SMP is this entire other thing. I agree that I can't believe we haven't even mentioned this far in the episode. I'm just going to ask that someone in the comments explains the Dream SMP to everyone else, because it will take us too long to try and explain it. We'll pin the best explanation of the Dream SMP. Ben, you know, there's someone watching going, the Dream SMP, yeah, the whole time. The SMP. Yeah, screaming. Yeah, screaming. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the other thing that he mentions about why he revealed his face is actually one of the most human things you could want, which is just that,\", 'A new way to make money as a creator': \" so this episode is sponsored by Jelly Smack.

All right, back to the episode.\", 'The real reason Dream took off his mask': \" So the other thing that he mentions about why he revealed his face is actually one of the most human things you could want, which is just that he wanted to hang out with his friends. Just get out in the world, be an actual creator, be a person, say hi to my friends finally. And that really is tactic number three, build a bridge. And what that means is like your digital world should be a bridge to your physical world. Dream talks about the concept that he's going to do IRL videos and this concept of IRL, meaning In Real Life, is actually explored in this TED Talk by Jordan Frith. There's probably no phrase that annoys me more than In Real Life. For one thing, as someone who got in many disagreements with my ex girlfriend over Facebook Messenger, I'm going to show you that was very real. It wasn't less real because it happened online. It had real consequences in the physical world. Anyone who's been cyber bullied, the fact that it happens on Facebook doesn't make it any better, it's still real life. It affects a physical body. His concept here is that the term IRL in Real Life suggests that there's two separate worlds, the digital world and the real life world. But actually that's not true. We actually exist in a hybrid space, as he calls it. So with Dream, primarily existing in cyberspace or in the digital world. Cyberspace. Yes, cyberspace, that's a 90s term, existing in cyberspace or the digital world, it's actually impossible. There's no world where he can just exist there because these worlds coexist. It was affecting his physical life by not revealing his face. Yeah. I read in articles somewhere that he was traveling from Florida to Georgia to go to the dentist so that no one would recognize him. That's because people knew he was from Orlando. But how would people recognize him? I don't understand that. By his voice. Uh, should have altered his voice. Come on, dream. But that's pretty aggressive. I think also read that he would go to Georgia to go to dinner with his mom sometimes. Like if you feel that restricted, like you can't go out to a restaurant in your own hometown, that's clearly this point where your online life is affecting your physical life. They are actually one in the same. They have implications. So I think that, you know, the lesson for creators here is that, no matter what, whatever you're building digitally from a community perspective, from a brand perspective, you should be thinking about how that interacts with the physical world because they're not two separate things. What did Dream lose by revealing his face? And what did he gain?\", 'Pros and Cons of unmasking': \" Let's talk about that. I think there's something really interesting that he lost, which is like we said with omitting his face, people got to fill in the gaps with who he was. He could be the ultimate superhero across race, socioeconomic levels, like he could be whatever you wanted him to be. And it's at no fault to him or anything. But once he revealed who he is, you lose some of the mystique and he no longer gets to be the superhero necessarily. He's clay a 23 year old from Orlando. Hi, my name is Clay, otherwise known as Dream Online. I think the interesting thing is like, he's going to create a new channel where he's going to do IRL experiences as clay. So kind of what has happened is there's two personas that are developing now. There is Dream and there's Clay. What he gained from, you know, a business perspective is also he can scale the premise and the concept and the brand of dream while building the brand of clay at the same time. Also think he's a creator of worlds more than he is a creator of videos. He's like Simon Cowell. Okay. No one's ever made that comparison. Simon Cowell is responsible for putting one direction together and then that became a world, right? And then some of them went off on their own. Dream essentially is responsible for the Dream SMP and you look at him on that panel at TwitchCon. He's all the way at the end and everyone on that panel is like a member of one direction. That's right. And at some point, Carole might be Harry Styles. I think Carl is Harry Styles. I think he kind of is Harry Styles. He grabs the mic for the first time everyone goes nuts. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I say all of this just to say that I think that actually may be what allows him to have longevity. The fact that his history is being a world builder, not just someone who follows trends and make videos. Like he builds environments for communities and creators to exist in all at once. Yeah, I think that's what Dream will continue to be. It's up for debate. Like who is Clay? Who is Clay going to become? Who knows? Now you guys have seen my face. Questions over. What does Dream look like? This is me unless I'm an actor. Might be an actor. Let's just open the package.\", \"Unboxing Dream's Mystery Package\": \" Let's open the package. What is in this package? Here we go. How do you, do I need something sharp? I would love some scissors. And now what is this a bracelet? God, the branding is so strong. Yeah, the green. It's so strong that it's like this brand. Marilyn, we got it open. You have a dart in your hand? When you have a dart coming. What if Marilyn just threw the dart in. She assassinated you in old school. Yeah. That would be a perfect out. So this is a bracelet from Dream. Marilyn, you bought this. How much does this cost and just explain this product to me? What is this? This is a Dream's USB bracelet. To buy the USB bracelet, we had to join the Dream Smile Club, which is an annual membership. We got the silver tier for $15.99 to get access to this member-only drop. And the bracelet itself costs $24.99. Would you say that was worth it? I think if you really care about him, it's worth it. Yeah. It is expensive. It's expensive. Oh, you know what this is? It's a snap bracelet. That's fun. That's so good. That brings me back. Oh, that's nice. Isn't that nice? Yeah, that's nice. So it's a bracelet, but it's also... What? Did I just break it? No. No. Okay. USB thumb drive. Yes. It has data on it. All right, cool. All right, let's see what's on this. There's a lot on this. Is it? Oh, my God. Baby photos? Childhood emails? Minecraft screenshots? Photos? 500 subscribers? That's cool. That's really cool. We've got time capsule. That was a photo of a dead rat. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Whoa, dude. So essentially, this is all just exclusive content. This would be like kind of similar to a Patreon, except his comes with a physical product. Right. Right. Like some people pay for a Patreon. Monthly, and you get exclusive photos behind the scenes, videos. That's essentially what this is, but he's just done in a different way that again is remarkable. Yeah. Wow. This is so interesting, because he's following the three rules that we just talked about. And then this product is remarkable. You have to talk about it. You know, it's exclusive content, but he did it through a physical piece that you order, that you get in the mail, that you have to plug into your computer, and that experience, right? So that's remarkable already. Also, he uses omission as a storytelling tool. It's a mystery box, because even as you plug this in, you don't know what's going to be on it. And then you have to explore yourself. It doesn't say start here or just watch this video. You're really navigating it on your own. And then he's recognizing that the digital world is a bridge to the physical world. Because again, this is a physical product. It's something that I now get to have in my room as a physical representation, or around my wrist as a physical representation of me being a part of this community. And I get to experience and have a physical experience while looking at these, right? This guy, DreamMan, he might become like the biggest marketer on the internet. He's very smart. He's damn good. Wow. Okay. Right here at the end of this video, you know more about Dream than when you started this video and you have a better understanding how he actually rose to his fame. And I can't wait to read your explanations of the DreamSMP. All right. Yeah.\"}, {'The YouTube “Break” Button': \" I said this to Colin. I was like, we have ads booked to the end of the year. Does that suggest that no matter what will be inspired to make? It does. But what if two weeks from now, we're like, I actually don't want to make something. But we have a sponsor. Yeah. Right. So what do we do then? Right. Right. And so I think that's for us, this happened in a pretty short window of going from net income being negative, you know, 18,000 to having a team and having an office. And I think we're actually now just coming back down from that and being like, it's outside of just the social media met. There's also the business side of it where it's like, oh, holy shit, I'm making money from this for the first time. Yep. Like real money for the first time. And that I think, especially for me growing up how I did where the dinner table conversation is exclusively about money, basically, you know, like you live in this scarcity mindset where for the first time when there's money, you're like, I got to do anything and everything to keep collecting this. And I think that's something that I'm reflecting on now and recognizing like, that's when it feels uncomfortable to tie your artistry to that feeling of scarcity. Yep. Because now you're making decisions in a completely different, with a completely different lens. Yeah. And by the way, I'm not immune to that either. Like, I'll get a call, go do this game show. We'll give you a bag, go do this. You'll get a bag, go perform in this country. You'll get a bag. And all the OGs, the, the Jedi that I call, the first thing that lasts me is like, but why are you doing the gig? Do you need the money? If they go, if you need the money, then go do it. Go do what you got to do. There's no judgment there. You can go do the pizza commercial or the Samsung Galaxy 5, you know, Verizon 5G commercial. It's the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5 for Ryzen 5G. I don't know if you know this, but it's the fastest 5G that's out there right there in the country. You can stream game on the go. Now, you may, that's right. You may, that's exactly not need that bag. Yeah. Or you may need it and it may finance the, the special. Yeah. And that bag actually did help pay for that set. You know, and so everybody's doing that math. The thing that I'm always wary of, I just don't want to go down. I call it the YouTube med school route. For 10 years later or 12 years later, you look back and you're like, I don't even know why did I just do this. Yeah. So I hope and pray for myself and for everybody that, you know, you, you find that true path of what you want to really do. And you use the algorithm. You don't let it use you. So to speak. I think that's very good. But a lot of your special and a lot of stuff I've listened to you talk about. You talk about control. I was curious actually one of the, the most interesting things I wrote down when watching King's Jester was in the beginning of the show, as you're talking about your daughter, you, you build this narrative of like she can decide it or she won't have to go to Kumaan, right? And Kumaan is kind of the representation of a lack of control. And then you start to explore the first time you felt control was through constant, stand up. Yeah. I'm just curious about your relationship with control\", 'Control \\\\u0026 The Pressure of Pace': \" and how that's evolved. Stand up was something that gave me a sense of agency. And when you figure out a joke, it's like figuring out a puzzle. You know, you, you put these two things into the equation and then out pops a reaction, which is laugh, laughter, which is an involuntary reaction. You can't force somebody to laugh. And so when you get that laughter, I get the validation of knowing, oh, you, you see the world the same way I, the same way I do. There's this feeling of feeling seen through that. You also can take that thing and be out of control. And so it's kind of crazy. The first jokes that I told really did save my life. And when I was taking it too far, I lost control. Now it became way too out of control. And so one of the things that I've gotten as I've gotten older is I realize, especially now that I have a wife and kids, that circle of influence and control on the steering wheel. I have less of. It's wild. This is the first time in my life all my friends, they have parents that are getting sick, parents that are passing away. For the first time, I'm seeing friends getting divorces. So the early trajectory of my life was people gaining things, gaining new experiences, holding hands for the first time, kissing for the first time, falling in love for the first time, making dorm room friends for the first time, first girlfriend, first, whatever. And now I'm entering this new chapter where I'm like, oh, I'm starting to lose things. Friends are losing their hair, their waistline, spouses, loved ones. And I've just become humbled by it. I've also taken chin checks. I've had wins. I've had losses. I've had shows. I've gotten cancelled all that sort of stuff. And it just kind of humbles you and goes, all right, it's not up to me. I'm curious. How does the pace of your creation now play into that control? Because I think it's like five years since homecoming. Yeah. Right? And then to me, I would look at that gap. It's too big, maybe. Also without Patriot Act being on, right? Yeah. Putting a lot of pressure on King's Jester. Right. And for us, we get to put out a video every week. We give up some control, right? Because of that pace. Yeah. We also gain control, like make adjustments. And keep moving. But for you, what's the give and take? What you gain? I think it's part of the scale and the size of the idea. So if you want to do a movie and your budget is anywhere between five to 30 million dollars, just to get capital, get in pre-production, edit, shoot, mix, master, something. It's going to take you a year and a half to two years. Some movies take five years. That's even longer, sometimes 10, just to get everything in order. That's the trade-off. The upside cost is deep emotional resonance. So you can't compare its apples and oranges. It's the you can't compare top gun, Maverick to a podcast episode. They're different things. And it goes back to what we were talking about in the middle of the episode. And when I wrote down here, what do you want to do? And then you have to build a series of decisions around that. So for this feature that we're about to do for the culture with Amazon, that's going to be two years of our life. We got to go cast. We got to go get the music. I got to go fly to India, get a music director. I got to go do this. I got to go get a choreographer. All these things need to be done. It's going to be a two-year journey. And I have to have the confidence in belief in myself. That's the check every morning. I'm getting checked. Maybe I should do this other thing. I believe in this idea so much that I'm going to continue on this path and hope that it translates and resonates. Because it's more honest than me following the social pressure of going to YouTube dental school. I mean, real talk. Real talk. That's the thing. Just everybody else is doing this. But the why I want to do for the culture. Because I've never seen a movie like that before is bigger than the why of I should do a podcast because all my other friends are doing podcasts. Or celebrities are getting paid out to do podcasts. That's not a good why to me. Yeah. So that's that look. I'm going to ask you guys a question because I have to humble myself before the audience. It's not my choice. The people in the comments, the people that watch this stuff. I don't know. I don't know if the decision I made is the right decision. I don't know. I hope it resonates. I hope people find value. I hope people think the specialist special or they might be like, I don't think so. I have to humble myself to the audience too. That's I love just to go back to what you said earlier about like kind of the center of the bell curve. Because for me, watching homecoming king and watching kings jester. Like when I step away, those have profoundly impacted my perspective. And the difference that it's made me think about. When we walked out of seeing it live, for me, I felt like asking myself the question of like, have I made anything like that? Or am I thinking constantly about tomorrow's post? Right. And I think that as we're like, this is a very fresh, even though we've been making YouTube videos for 10 years, this is a very fresh level of success we're having right now. Sure. And so it's an evaluation period of like how deep do we want to go down this path? And we talk about it a lot because I think you do have to get to a place of financial stability to have that conversation to say, what do I, okay, now what do I want to do with this? And walking home, me, I give just some advice. If there's anybody that's a creator, keep your burn low.\", \"Hasan Minhaj's best advice for creators\": \" So I still keep my burn low. Like we lease, we lease our Honda Odyssey, shut out to white planes Honda. Oh yeah. Least payment is $538 a month. That shit's going back after three years. So we still lease the Honda. We rent. I don't own my house. We rent still. And what I do is I keep that capital available for 186K. And the capital that we have available allows me to have Tyler, PV, we have a full-time team and we're able to move quickly and nimbly on an opportunity. And if we need to put up the capital or the bag to do a co-pro deal on a movie, we can. I'm not going to lie though. I mean, again, I'm just as vulnerable as anybody else when I go to those architectural digest YouTube videos. And it's like, hi, I'm Dakota Johnson. And welcome to my airy Palm Springs. And I'm like, fuck, I have to give Richard the landlord a rent this month. By the way, so we're talking it's it's October 3rd. Yeah. Special comes out October 4th. How do you guys think it's going to do? Because I'm in a very vulnerable. I think it's going to do great. I think you said earlier, you're like, look, I did 168 shows with like in-person immediate feedback. And I've watched some of the behind the scenes on your YouTube channel actually that Tyler made of you. Work shopping the really early stuff before you even went on tour. This product you've put in the work in front of a very diverse and large amount of people. I'm not worried for you. Okay, got it. Yeah. Because you've tested it again and again. And again, right. Right. You know, I know I think in one of those videos, you said it was 110 minutes. It's not showing up on Netflix at 110 minutes. No, 66 now. Yeah. I think it's been tested. Yeah, my my perspective on it is that I think that through homecoming King and King's gesture, both they build depth and not width. And I think depth is the future. And all the creators that are going to last a long time are going to build depths. Oh, wow. Because the thing is I have I have a very deep connection with your story when you release your next piece. I'm there. Wow. Yeah, I'm already writing. Right. Like you're you're live and at the Civic's Arts Plaza again. I'm there. Wow. You know, like and that depth, I think the thing that I think a lot of artists don't fully realize is that you need depth with a very finite amount of people. You don't need millions and millions and millions of people. Right. Right. Right. That's width. And some people are built for width. Yeah, that's a famous celebrity game. Yeah. That's cool. But like you're building depth, like how deeply personal this piece is, how much like when I watch it, I have guttural reactions to the way you go from this range of emotions from laughter to complete silence. Uh-huh. And I'm like, I'm with you, right? And you mentioned this advice you got from from Pashant that like you were speaking too fast in some of your stand-up stuff. Yeah. And he said to like let the audience come to you. I think this special is the representation of that where like I felt like I was coming to meet you. You weren't coming at me. Yeah. You know, with information, you weren't telling a story about someone else. Yeah. You know, when I watch Patriot Act, like you're telling you're you're interspersing or like interstitial. There's stuff about you. Yeah. But this is about you. And I'm I'm clicking and deciding to stay for you. Wow. Thank you. And that's depth. And so that's my perspective on the King's Jester is like I don't think this is this should be gauged from a success perspective on how many people watch it. But on the impact you have on the people who do. Wow. Thank you. Yeah. I agree with that. I think it's so personal that what you're making can only be made by you. Yes. Oh, wow. And that's so interesting. Whereas like you mentioned like Top Gun Maverick like Miles Tellers in it. But if it was someone else, I would still watch it. Oh, right. Different mediums. Right. But like you're creating something so deeply personal. Yeah. Like if I make it through the full special. Yeah. And I enjoyed it. It's like I'm not going to forget that hour plus I just spent with him. Yeah. Human. I hope so. You know, and there's the you know, when we were in edit Tyler and PV and I were in the edit for almost two and a half months just editing it and picking our select shots and all that stuff and doing road on certain things and getting Ludwig Gornson to come in and compose music for it. And in the worst moments, there were these moments where I'm like, man, am I am I an author writing books in like a digital age? Is this a is this a thing that people don't want or care for anymore? And I remember Prashant told me after we were like in edit to like two or three o'clock in the morning and he was like, man, if you wanted to like live your life determining what the audience wanted, you and I should have just been executives. Where we're just these kind of creative VCs of like, that seems like a good idea. That seems like it's a good idea. He's like, we're on the other side of it because we have something to say. So the tension he's always reminding me of is like, don't don't just always be a network studio exec to your creative process. Try to keep that, keep that channel open and pure. And one of my favorite scenes and genius, the Kanye doc is when Ferrell listens to through the wire. Yeah. That's crazy. And was like, man, just keep that channel open of like that thing you really want to say. Yeah. And if that thing I want to say, it happens to hit at a moment like the White House correspondent's dinner or homecoming king or whatever. And it happens to match up with what the audience wants. Great. If not, just keep keep your burn low enough that you can still do this for another 40 years. I love that. I think the thing that I really respect about you is that you're not for everybody. And I think that maybe you don't, maybe you feel differently. But like I am very concerned about not like being for everybody. That anyone can come across something and be like, oh, I'm into this. But you are very much not for everybody. Like there's times where after homecoming king where I talked about your special in a group and there's some people were like, I don't like that guy. He talks too fast. He's too aggressive. Yeah. And I'm like trying to argue on your behalf. Oh, thank you. No, but I'm saying, like I was the one. I was like, I don't get it. I can't. Yeah. But when you have that, like when you're not for everybody, you build again, depth and passion with the people you are for. And I think that's like that's the that what builds longevity in this career in my opinion. I'm curious your perspective on how the regular output of specifically comedy has impacted the landscape of of comedy. Yeah. Where you know, you mentioned Tim Dylan, you mentioned Andrew Schultz, right? Yeah. You know, but Chrysher, Norman, Maru, like the list goes on and on. Output is wild. Yeah. It's great. You know, but Schultz puts out infamous in this crazy way. Yeah, it's great. It's amazing how it did that. And at the same time, you guys kind of gave them some advice. Yeah. Yeah. That was really fun. Yeah. I mean, that was super fun. And like we taught Schultz and I talk all the time. Yeah. His output is insane. Yeah. It's so much content. He's doing more creators than we are. He's really do. He's putting it. He got that creator. Yeah. Now he's like vlogging and streaming and like he's he's putting out a lot. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm curious your perspective on how the output of comedy has impacted just the landscape of comedy. Yeah. I think what's really beautiful is this is there was a period of time where comedy central and HBO knighted people. And generally, there's only five to ten people that could get him. And out of those five to ten people that got in, maybe three to four were theater acts and maybe one or two were stadium acts. Now in this decentralized landscape, I think there's almost 40 theater acts. Yeah. And there's probably 10 to 15 arena acts. That's great. I think that's really great. And I think what's awesome is is what Andrew's doing, what Tim is doing, what all those guys are doing is they're they're building that group of people that's like, I want to go see you in theaters. I want to go see you in arenas. And what's awesome, I think with that capital and freedom is now they can imprint their worldview on the world. However, they see fit. And it doesn't have to be backed by concast or viacom or time Warner or Netflix. So there's pros and cons to everything. And they got to they got to meet a demanding production schedule. But I think actually what they're showing is YouTube is now the new home for non scripted content. And I think streaming is now the home for premier scripted content. Interesting. Yeah. So when people are like late night is dead, it's not dead. The idea of a guy sitting there giving you their opinion with their friends. That's tough crowd with Colin Quinn. It's just now moved to YouTube. That's the home of non scripted shows. Right. And people like Marquis Brownlee that used to be a show on like CNET or these other traditional media legacy media players. Now he's his own CNET. But it's it's the category of it is non scripted. Now it's just on YouTube. So that's it. I just see it that way. If you want to scale your vision, you need 20 to 50 million dollars to do a movie or do a project. You go on streaming. If you want to be independent and the capital need is maybe $5 million or less. Yeah. You're on YouTube. And they're both great for different things. You know. I think you guys have pulled back a little bit from your YouTube channel. Yeah. Remember when you launched\", 'Why Hasan Minhaj stopped uploading to YouTube': \" it. What was the reason there? Was it like we're going to do this bring people behind the scenes, put butts in seats. Was it like a backup plan? Yeah. Sure. What was the thought there? I think there was a there was a thing of maybe let's show people the the making of this thing. I think the only problem is is the there isn't a ton of scalability after like four or five episodes. I get it. He's on the road. He's in a tour bus. He's in a green room. He's fixing jokes and he goes and he tries to joke out. So I think that was really it. The thing that I'm always juggling is the time capital spent doing that versus making and fixing the show and making the show great. Yeah. servicing that or fixing right now or in pre-production on the movie making sure that script is great. Versus like I got to service this thing this week. So I think if there was a world where I ever were to do like nonscripted a full-time show. Yeah. That's basically what Patriot Act was. Our YouTube channel Deep Cuts. All that stuff was a nonscripted YouTube show. I think a lot of our fans, those five, six million people that would rock with us every week came from YouTube and then there was a group of people that watched us Sundays on Netflix. How did you know\", \"When it's time to quit or keep going\": \" when things weren't working and when to move on from them in your dark career? Yeah. Yeah. I think like yeah. This is just a humility thing. Like you know what's really interesting is I've just gotten to this age where I realize life will chin check you and nobody comes out of this unscathed. I don't care where you are in the political spectrum. You look at Donald Trump's life and the licks he's taken. He's lost his brother to alcoholism. The bankruptcies he's filed for. Look at Joe Biden's life losing multiple children, losing a spouse, losing multiple runs for the presidency. Again, I'm not assigning qualitative value to either of them. I'm not here to get into a political argument. What I'm saying is the longer you play the game, you're going to get chin checked by life. And I realized nobody comes out of this thing unscathed. The humbling thing about life and the game is the game will reveal your hand. So when I was 18, 19 and you know I'm auditioning for things and things don't come my way, I had this vision. I was going to be on a sitcom and then I would go tour and those dreams die. Like eventually you hit an age and you're like 30 years old. You're not going to play a 19 year old anymore. It's over. That dream is over. I had a dream of doing a late night set on Conan. And like even on my Vimeo page it says Conan late night set v7.mov and you know that private Vimeo link you send. And by the time I even was able to get on the show, I was already like the daily show. It's over. That dream died. You know I was never able to do that thing that I always dreamed of. I'm 37 now. Like I can't play certain roles that 25 year olds can play. And that's okay. Like things ending, things dying is actually okay. That's part of life. Life is about graduating. So to answer your question, the game just checked me. So it was no different than me trying out for the basketball team. I tried my best. I'm a senior. This is the last year I can try out for varsity. It's over. And you cry, you mourn and you just move on. And the time that I've spent with OGs, they're really good at mourning and letting go. And that's okay. That's part of life. And that's that's really what happened. You know, some of those dreams ended in new things happened. And that's okay. And I think it's for the best man. Do you imagine about 37? I dress like a 19 year old. And I'm still playing that like L.A. Peter Pan syndrome game. I mean, there's guys that are like 47 years old. And they dress like they're 23. It's it's horrifying. But look at you know what I mean? You're just like what is what is wrong with you? You can move on. Yeah, totally. You know, and you look at people. I even look at like my fashion icons, music icons, Janelle Monet, David Beckham, Farell Williams. They have aged so gracefully. And they've aged with a level of like sanity and clarity in their thoughts. Man, oh man, you meet some people that were like hot in the 90s, early 2000s. You're like, bro, what's happening upstairs? Like what happened to you? You know, and they didn't mourn and move on. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like it's okay. Like life is about graduate. You got to graduate, mourn it and move on. You know, and so I got it. And you got to do that with humility. So whether these next projects that I do work or fail, I come to it with humility. It's between God, the audience, they decide. I love that. Appreciate that. That was a good perspective. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I really got to do religious again. But it's the best facts. There's no getting around this. Yeah. You know, I mean like that speaks to like the long game that this is. I appreciate it. I appreciate it. Now with you guys. Thank you so much. Thank you. Yeah. This is such a dope conversation. Yeah. This is awesome. Yeah. You guys are great. Appreciate it. Yeah.\"}, {'The Mythical Machine, Explained.': \" Let's all do nothing but this right now. Make it as good as we possibly can and then say, oh, we won't do it again for another month. So it's basically finding all the efficiencies you can in your schedule. And it, and I don't know, somehow we've, I don't think that would necessarily be fulfilling for, again, it kind of go back to this like, if you're just a pure artist and you like, wait for the inspiration and you follow the creative flow and that's how, how you operate. So that's a beautiful thing and probably the majority of artists and they're going to kind of like, kind of maybe work on their own. Maybe they have an assistant or something like that. But we just, our aspirations were to just build something together and have this team and see what we can do. And it's kind of like playing a game and figuring out a puzzle for us. And so we, we, we take a little pleasure in finding those efficiencies and being like, yeah, we can shoot 12, let's shoot 12 sketches today. So beyond good Mythical Morning and how you guys are operating, like, how does the company actually work? What is the pie chart of how money is made in this creative company? Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, going back, this isn't even really something that we really started focusing\", 'How Rhett \\\\u0026 Link made money': \" super closely on to like 2015, 2016, right? But definitely when we started really taking a look at it, we were the biggest piece of the pie and also the majority of the pie was YouTube revenue. And so we were like, okay, well, it's kind of inevitable that this is the biggest piece of the pie given that our flagship properties are YouTube first. And that's where the best monetization is. When you say YouTube revenue, you mean add sense. I mean add sense. Okay, got it. Yeah. But we were like, we want to actively work to make the pie bigger, but to make this piece of the pie smaller in relation to the rest of the pie. And so over the course of like what, you know, six years or so, we have gotten to a place where while the YouTube add sense revenue piece is the largest piece of the pie, it is not the majority. Not really close to the majority at this point. You know, e-commerce business has just grown very significantly and are just straight up integration business. So on a top of add sense, but just straight brand integrations has grown significantly. So those are really the, and also our community, what we call the community piece of the pie with the Mythical Society, right? Those are our biggest sort of the content, you know, commerce and community. Those are the biggest pieces of the pie. And then there's other things that are, you know, more speculative like the stuff we do in traditional or, okay, books and that kind of thing, which is not, it's not constant. It's like, oh, you might get a book deal and then a few years past, you might get another one that kind of thing tend to be the smaller pieces of the pie. And live shows go into that as well. Yeah. Yeah.\", 'Why Rhett \\\\u0026 Link launched Mythical': \" So from things like that, like shooting shows to all the sudden we have mythical, which is such a bigger thing, is that like a deliberate decision to not just make shows and content, but have an overarching media company. And was there, I'm so curious about this, of like, if there was a moment where you guys were like, well, we could be retin' link and have good Mythical Morning and build that. And that's a fantastic career. But then this moment of like, but let's actually, let's build a bigger company than that. Honestly, I think it started from a very practical place of just like, what's our retirement plan? I think it was just like, we're not going to do this forever. We're not going to appeal to this audience forever. When are they going to get tired of us? I don't want to go back to being an engineer. I don't want to have to go work for somebody. Like, you just, and so it's like, okay, what can we do? We've got this platform. We like making content. We know what makes good content. We know how to recognize somebody who will work well with this kind of audience. So let's just see what else we can get people interested in. For me, that was the thinking. And then once it starts working, like, once you do something like, oh, you know, you watch somebody like Mythical Chef Josh go from the guy who just makes really interesting food to the guy who can make really interesting food, but can also be very interesting as he's doing it and telling you about it. Like, we love that process of seeing somebody kind of come into their own. And now Mythical Kitchen, like, that team over there is, they're playing the game that we used to play of like, oh, here's an idea. Let's try it. Let's see how they respond to it. You know, we might go show up on an episode of something over there from time to time. And we obviously are kind of keeping up with what they're doing on a high level and how the team is expanding and all this stuff. But when it comes to that, the game, playing that creative feedback game that you have to play to be a creator, they're doing that in a self-sustaining way. And it's just a fun process to be a part of. We want to replicate that. Can you expand upon playing that feedback game?\", 'How to play the YouTube game and win': \" I think that's an important thing to discuss. We actually both, we just took a break and we both read Creativity Inc. We guys read that. Great book, yeah. It's a great book. And there's a lot of that discussion around, you know, exploring the neighborhood, quote, unquote, discussion around failure of like, I got this idea. I just got to go down the path and see. And I'll be okay with failure because every, whatever I do, it'll yield new information for me. Exactly. You know, and like, that was, I've never, I haven't read a book that reminded me so much of what our day to day life feels like, you know, of trying something and it not working. And then the past 10 years, we tried so many things, but those have all informed what we do today. Right. And I'm just curious about, if you could expand on that feedback game that creators have to play. Yeah. I mean, it's, I mean, the, when we talk about the, when something works, it's like, we had to learn to say, okay, we're looking for things to work. We are saying this is a test and then we're going to take action based on it. It's like you start to develop that feed. Yeah. You start to plan to the feedback mechanism. And you know, I think that when we, when we first said, is Cinco de Mayo in 24, 2015, whenever we did Will it Taco? Let's just throw stuff in a taco for an episode. It was just an episode idea. And then we, you know, it actually took us a little while to realize, we should do that again, but not with tacos. We should do Will it as a sub series. Yeah. And so, but we had that signal. Then you get to a point where it's, you know, okay, we, our risk is low. We have five videos every day. We can learn something from every single video. Everyone can be another Will it Taco. So now we're like looking for it. We're trying to like, trying to remember what led to Will it Taco. So then you can build a, systems for a team to then come up with more of those things. Yeah, every, every video that goes up, there's people that watch the performance of the video and then change the thumbnail. It's like you, you start to say, what else, what else can we change? Yeah. Can we change the title? Can we change the thumbnail? Can every little thing make it perform better? Everything's an experiment. And then, well, you have to, as every creator, if you want to be a successful creator, you have to embrace the fact that your audience is not only the final audience, but they're also your focus group. Traditional media, you've got the focus group and then you've got the intended audience. And that distinction goes away. Your fans are your focus group. And if you don't listen to them, you're not going to be a successful creator long-term. And you also, we were just talking about this earlier today, there's two aspects to your content. There's the product and there's the performance. And a lot of really, you know, creatively, purest people can never accept that the performance of the content. And so therefore, like the marketing, the title and the thumbnail are important and potentially just as important or more important than the content itself. Now, we've always said the content is king and we want to have a great product and we're never going to let that suffer. But getting people to watch that is such an important part of it. You don't embrace the quality of the product and then the performance itself of that product. It just can't happen. It's going to lose too much steam. So on the first half, it's like you find signal that something is working. Can we do this better next time? You know, can we double down on this? Can we triple down on this? Is this a format that we can do every month? You know? And then you get to a point where once you do that, it's actually harder to find the signal for when you should stop doing something when you need to move off. Interesting. That's the real challenge. It's easy. Like, oh, this video works. That's easy. Let's do it again. I believe in this video. It didn't work. But if we tweak these things, it'll happen again or it'll find its audience. So this format can work. But then, like, how much longer are we going to do with it episodes of Good Mythical Morning? We do one a month. Like, for eight years now? So it's like, well, how much longer are we going to do this? Like, how much food are we going to continue to do on Good Mythical Morning? Like, what is the signal of ambivalence? You know? That's a real challenge for us at this point. Like, don't hold on to your old signals too long. Well, and this is something that every long-term creator struggles with as well is the\", 'How to experiment on YouTube': \" audience expectations kind of keep you in a certain place. And experimentation outside of those expectations is not rewarded with clicks. And so you're actually more incentivized in the short term to return to formats and milk things that really, really worked with you. And he means literally milk milk things in our case. And the thing that we are, because it's going into the 10th year, or I guess that going into the 11th year of the show, the thing that we really been focusing on. It's, we're halfway through the 11th year. Yeah, we are. And we are. Yeah. Having to basically say, hey, we're going to take this risk. We're going to do this thing. And it's funny, the feedback that you get from the clicks, the views, and then the long-term viewer. So right here in this very spot, we recently attempted to put a shoe on a horse. I mean, an actual horse shoe. Oh, so you're being serious. You're being serious. Oh, yeah, very serious. Yeah. I do not recommend doing it either. I haven't done it. I may hold it. Yeah. Yeah. And so that's an idea of an episode where, you know, okay, the long-term fans are like, I love it when you guys do these things that are kind of outside the box and it really makes me, you know, they get very vocal about it. But we get a report from, you know, our guy whose job is it to give us the report that said, well, this, will we die shoe in a horse video? Is the, is number 10 of your last 10 videos. Oh, yeah. And so what does that mean? Does that mean we should never shoe a horse again? Well, there's a, what about the other three legs? Mm-hmm. Now, what, I mean, what does this really mean? And the fact that you don't put a shoe right up? Because also it's like your first time experimenting. Try putting a shoe on it. On that, that format. Yeah. That, that's the thing that I think is terrifying as creators, especially as like for us, with as you start to have newly found momentum, you get a 10 out of 10. You're like, well, let's never do that again. Even if it was like, okay, we just need to build on it. The audience, like, it's something new. But it's terrifying to experiment when you're up against YouTube. So I imagine you got pitched the idea about the shoe on the horse. I think that was that, that was our idea. I think so. Yeah, because for good mythical summer, we specifically were saying, let's do some more experimental, more experiential stuff. And I was like, we love watching those, you know, those videos on TikTok where they're changing some of the, they're just like, yeah, yeah. Of course, those are good videos. Yeah. How do we make that a side and do it? It's easy to do that. Yeah, it kind of. Yeah. So quick and easy. Yeah. Right. That's satisfying. Yeah. And so that is something that we're really talking about with the team is, you know, how do you maintain? Because this, not, it's hard to stay encouraged when you do something that everybody here, everybody at Mythical and then all the like hardcore long-term fans are very excited about it. It gets 60, 50, 60% of what you would get if you just set there and ate something funny at the table. Yeah. And so, but our theory is that you've got to invest in those long-term fans or else you're just going to have a really, really slow declination, you know. Yeah. Do you shoe a horse or do you beat a dead horse? Oh, nice. That's a lot of them now. That's it. Wow. You shoe the horse. I think what's cool is to look back in time and look at this feedback game you guys are playing on YouTube and understanding like, Rhett's most embarrassing moment followed by the next day, uploading links most embarrassing moments. And like, you look at that and I think quantity of uploads really supports that feedback game, right? Like you don't, you're not waiting a week to try it again. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, if you're going to say this works, let me go back and look at the last six months of their channel. Yeah. Oh, he tried this character, but he didn't have the accent down. And then he tried this character. And then eventually they got to a place where they were doing the same thing every single time. And there's something beautiful in seeing the result of that game having been one, but then there's, especially on the short form scale of Tik Tok, I'm just like, oh man, what's you going to do next? Yeah. Yeah, because he's like, he's gonna do this character forever. I thought about that with the drone dancing guy. Remember that guy? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It was, I was like, oh wow, how long does this, the dancing go, you know? Yeah, yeah. And you just said, remember that guy, which maybe that guy's not gonna like, because he might still be doing it. But I mean, that was like everywhere on TikTok. And so one advantage that GMM has is that, well, it's still at its core is a variety show where we're not doing the same thing every single day. There may be, it may seem like, oh, this feels like a remix of this idea or whatever, but it really is a playground for ideas and it's not a character doing a bit for half a minute and that's it. And you gotta do the same thing every time. But I remember, you know, you talk about the most embarrassing episodes back to back. That reminded me, there was a certain point\", 'How Good Mythical Morning adapted': \" when we had the conversation, we're gonna run out of stories. Like what is good Mythical Morning, good and be? And so that's when you started to work in more formats. Yeah. You know, let's play games with each other. You'll know all the answers I want. Oh, we can switch it back and forth. You know what? Oh, let's see if we can taste if something's from Walmart or Target, you know? Just just an idea. Yeah. I mean, good God. Look at us now. You know, it's like, I mean, look at all the stuff we eat. But again, it's like, okay. And then you, it's still the same challenge. Like, where are we going with all this? You know, we gotta, you know, this belief that the bottom is gonna fall out. I don't, I feel pretty good about that not happening at this point. But I'm still very much engaged in what? Where are we gonna take this show? Because it will, you know, if you just keep following the same signals, then they'll, you know, it'll, it's a downward spiral. If you keep doing the same thing, yeah. What's that, what's that saying? It does seem to like, like the basis of the show, fortunately, is just getting to hang out with you two. Hopefully. It is like whether you're eating food, which is like what's happening right now, or occasionally chewing a horse. Yeah. You go back years and years, the one constant is that we're getting to hang out with you. Yeah. Right. And you do have to play a little bit of that game, obviously. But you've built such a loyal group of people over the years that are excited for whatever your... Yeah, they're gonna come back. It's really those, it's the margin between those who are gonna watch every day and those who are just gonna click on the stuff that entices them. And apparently, as we have proven that putting food in the thumbnail makes, I guess everyone's just hungry. I kind of relate to that. People are hungry most of the time. Yeah. It's universal. That's the thing. It's like we all can understand what it feels like to eat food. And when we see you eat disgusting food or weird food, it's like I can also kind of have that sensation a little bit in my mind. So it's relatable. It's relatable. It's enjoyable. I can place myself a bit there. I'm curious at this point, how important is external validation\", 'Are Rhett \\\\u0026 Link proud?': \" for you to personally have like showing up on Fallon or I was watching Hot Ones and Sean Evans brought up how post Malone when he was on the show said he was like a huge fan. No, he did it for four years. Yeah, he is. Like, that was cool. Yeah. I think you guys rank those types of experiences now in your career next to maybe when an episode does really well. Like how important are those moments? Yeah, I mean, it really depends. Like, I mean, some of the biggest career moments for us are because we are of an age that's like, all right, the fact that the first song that we ever wrote in middle school, we performed on the tonight show with the roots backing of stuff. Yeah, I mean, that's the career highlight. The fact that yeah, that post Malone is a fan and then he turns out to be such a sweetheart is a doubly great. I think it's all based on, this is a theory and I've seen it proven true time and time again. Whatever was most thrilling and valuable to you when you were 10 years old, those are the validation experiences that will be the most meaningful to you for the rest of your life. Getting a lot of views on a YouTube video, that didn't exist when I was 10 years old, right? The tonight show existed. Rockstars existed. And so it's in your DNA in some way to really value what would have been the coolest thing that you could have experienced as a kid? And then when you get to experience those things as an adult, it's always gonna seem more meaningful. That's why every bone back home gets excited when we get a show on the Food Network. Because they're in the same boat, like TV, when I was a kid, the best thing you could be on was TV. Red Linker on TV now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know their daily show gets more views than that Food Network show, but, you know, TV, TV, I am on TV. Yeah, so TV or TV. Yeah, so yeah, going on Fallon, as many times as we've done it, and it doesn't translate into views. Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure. Everybody's like, I just thought I was gonna discover you guys on Fallon. But we don't see like an increase in subscribers or anything. It's just this validating experience to be able to do something that you would have thought was really cool when you were 10 years old. When you guys look ahead, how long do you feel\", 'Will Rhett \\\\u0026 Link retire from Good Mythical Morning?': \" like you can do the show? And do you want to do the show? And where does the show go? Like how does it keep you guys going? You know, our desire for a good Mythical Morning is we really feel like, I mean, speaking of the tonight show and what it was like to be the way we perceived that as a kid, is you perceive the tonight show to be this institution that kind of, you know, oh, my dad watched this and now I watch it. Now I watch it and my kids will probably watch it. It was this entertainment institution. I think we're begun to see the potential for a good Mythical Morning to feel like that, you know, culturally. So I think what that means for us is that, I mean, as long as people are still interested in watching it, I mean, I'm too much of a performer to say that I'm gonna just do it. I'm gonna run it to the ground even when people have lost interest except a couple of hundred people who are just like, we still want more. But as long as people are still engaged and still enjoying it and we're still engaged and we're still enjoying it, which our mission is always to find ways for us to keep enjoying it and mix it up, which we've gotten pretty good at. I don't think I can put a number on it. How long will we'll do it? Yeah, I think right now, we're very engaged in terms of what's next for Good Mythical Morning? And how do we lead our team through that? And I'm just mean a creative iteration where we're, what are the new things we can be excited about? I think right now, we're excited about that development. Like, Good Mythical Morning is at a juncture where, okay, how are we gonna evolve the show beyond what it is right now? Instead of chasing that feedback loop, which I'll say, specifically the food feedback loop. How do we break the show out of that? Because we're just not comfortable being defined in that way by people who, if you know, you know, but we'd still like more people to know that that's not what the show actually is, especially, and if you watch Good Mythical More, I mean, and you're a dedicated fan of that, if you know, you know what we've started to say. And it's like, I think it's exciting that there's so much potential there, like the heart of Good Mythical Morning is still beating. Still beating, like Huey Lewis said. And so I think we're excited about what we're gonna, where it's gonna go. So to me, that's really all that matters. It matters the most, you know? And then that people are watching, and those things are hand in hand, and then we don't go broke doing it for some reason. Right. We have to start paying YouTube to do it. Right. That would probably be an issue. That would be an issue for everyone. Do you think there's a point where maybe, you know,\", \"GMM's new hosts?\": \" same as the tonight show as an institution and new hosts come through that new hosts would maybe take over? I think that our mentality on that, I can say we are not actively seeking that at this point, but if it comes down to the show not existing, looking at these guys. Yeah, I saw. Link looked at me with a totally different eyes right there, and I was like, am I, how do I do this audition right now? If we have to choose between the show, stopping or continuing with other hosts who can do a great job, hopefully better than us, then that will definitely continue to show. But how would that happen? Yeah. Impossible. Is it? You think it's impossible? I think there's no world where it's the same, you know? Maybe. So yeah, I don't know. And like John Stewart left the daily show, and like it's not the same, but there's another version of it. Yeah, it's interesting because I think when that happens, it'll be an experiment that, I guess it, I know that Ray William Johnson tried to do that for a while or he's just doing guest hosts. Guest hosts. He's back now. Yeah, he's back now with a different show, right? Go for him, by the way. Yeah. But yeah, it'll be an experiment because yeah, it's been done time and time again with traditional television properties. Right. And yes, it's like people, I don't like this new person. And then all of a sudden there's a lot of people like, oh, I didn't watch John Stewart. I only watched Trevor Noah. Yeah. So again, no, no, even short term plans for that, like there's even long term, there's no plans at all for that right now. But that is the way that we see us, us stopping the show is giving it to somebody else one day. Yeah. Not us just stopping the show and just walking off into the sunset. That could also, we could change our minds. Well, if there isn't somebody, if there's not somebody who wants to do it, who, who, who, who, you know, who we want to do it. Yeah. I mean, I've heard some people say it's impossible. I did, yeah. So thanks so much for sitting down with us. Yeah. Thanks for having us. I'm glad we chat with you guys. We're all in a lot of space. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for having us. And now we're gonna go check out the rest of the space. Yeah. Let's do a tour. Yeah. Yeah.\"}, {\"Cody Ko \\\\u0026 Noel Miller on Ending That's Cringe\": \" I think we both like trying new things and pushing ourselves and learning especially. So like at that point, the last ones came out like when we were on tour. Yeah. So we were really focused on the live show and, you know, going show by show tweaking it depending on what the audience laughed at, what it didn't, you know, that was taking\", 'The Rise of Tiny Meat Gang Music': \" up a lot of our mental real estate. So was music starting to play a bigger role during that time? It was. Yeah. Yeah. And so we, yeah, music continued to kind of be a factor. And then the pandemic hit. And then I think that's when, when the pandemic hit out, naturally, everyone like re, you know, they kind of thought about things more in like what does the future look like? And I think that was an easy moment for us to be like, well, probably not going to be like wrapping about Dix for very long. So like, maybe we should, you know, try some other things that present more of a challenge and something we can like really care about really sync our teeth into. Yeah. With your music, like I was talking to Cody about this, like some of the streams on Spotify and your guys music are crazy. Yeah. I think I'm pretty sure Walkman is almost gold. Yeah. It's like 86 or 90 million streams and like broke bitch. Uh, it's like 45, 47 million. And I also put on that song. Yeah. When I was doing some research for this podcast, right? I've heard that song. Yeah. But I put it on and I was like, how, how serious were you when you were making this song? You kind of like, did you, because that's like a good song. And I don't know the time, like the emphasis on like the comedy being a main character started to maybe like, not that it went down, but like the quality of the music started to do. It was almost like you guys were flexing in this way of like, no, we could have, like if we were, yeah, it was like awkward for watching. It was like, this is like, just, this is just, just, you know, like, actually wanted to do this. You could just do this. That's what we were going for. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know what it is. It's awkwardly good. Well, next to all of the other music that comedians or just even YouTubers put on YouTube, it just, it was the same character. It's got to be Josh Richards though. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. I think it's funny, because when some people break down the music, it's really interesting to see what their interpretations of it are, like even hearing what you guys have to say is really interesting, because I guess the general theme here is that the things that we made, we never had these really deep thoughts about it. It's funny when I'll go on the road. And even to this day, and I've had people ask, like, what, what, like, what was your process, like making music? And I'm like, it's very complicated. Someone makes a beat and then mean Cody, look at each other and say, do you want to go first? And then one of us records. And then the other one goes, yeah, that, that works. And then the other one records and then we're like, yeah, sick. And a lot of it is supported by the producers that we know, just between like Spock and Diamond Pistols there. They're, they're always the ones to really make the music like do something. So yeah, I do feel they got to a point where it was getting just like a little too far away from comedy. And I'm like, maybe it's a little too horny now. That's too horny. I think for me, like, broke bitch was the moment where I was like, this is a little too good. Like this song, I can casually listen to it. Like, I like this song. And that's when it was like, I felt like there was an inflection point of life. But these guys are just going to become like a music. Yeah, yeah. Make good music. No, because there's the music industry is the worst industry to be part of. Let's dig into that. Yeah. Yeah. I want to, I want to hear about it. So, it's actually interesting because you're bringing up Joji, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay, someone can be like a comedian, have funny videos on YouTube and then go into music. Oh, I think I'm going to be successful. Yeah, yeah. Like Tim Heidecker does music now. A lot of people do it for sure.\", 'The Problem with Singing a Record Deal': \" But I think what's interesting is the business side and the money side of music. A lot of people hear that labels working with labels isn't like the best experience or whatever. But when we were independent, like, you know, and then it wasn't even a conscious decision. It was just like, oh, yeah, we're putting out music. Let's just do it on our own because we have a marketing platform built in. We can just make a video on YouTube and like, we were making a lot of money. Yeah. Like from streams. Yeah, we're making a good chunk. Like, like, you know, I don't even, I won't put a number on it. But like, it was good, like for an independent, you know, for people in our project. Yeah. Like, it generated a significant amount of income and then we signed with a label and we made zero money. But I mean, like, that's, you know, that's no shade to the label or anything, like, I think. That's just how it works. Yeah. And why did you go for make sense for people that don't have that platform that we had worked so long to build already? We did it as kind of like a legitimacy thing. It was like, we signed with a label and, you know, then we're on the same label that was like Posner. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. You know, Aristotle goes way back. Yeah. Yeah. You know, famous name. So it was legitimacy, but also you get an advance. We got to do it. We got to do it. But no, could you explain like, why does the money go down so significantly? Yeah. It's theft. No. The contract that they make you sign has a lot of built-in things that you discover along the way. Got it. Mostly it's, it's recruitment. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what really fucks you is that, you know, they give you this advance and it's money which is one of your album, right? Yeah. They also take a long time to give you that as well. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I like everyone that works at the label like they were all really great and had the best intentions. Like, and like I said, it works for other people. Right. But I think for us, like we're, we've always been so independent and we've always done everything by ourselves. Yeah. That that relationship just didn't really work as well for us. And it's also like the industry was changing so much. Like I don't know the record label would think like the way you guys did that SeatGeek integration in one of your music videos. Yeah. But we did that because otherwise that money would have came out of our, our recruitment. So like, but they pay you a certain amount of money and then to like fund your album or whatever. But then you only receive royalty money after you've paid that back and then all the marketing fees on top of that. Right. Yeah. So they a lot of certain amount of money towards music videos or whatever, but the rest, you have to pay that back. So you end up paying for everything. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How it's traditionally been. Yeah. Fun fact about broke pitch. So there's a crazy like sequence of events because basically we needed to finance it. So I pitched like, okay, what if we do this ad at the end and we can kind of tied into a story. Like, oh, great. Simultaneously, I don't know if I think I can say this. I pitched a key from Key and Peel directly to be like in the music video. Like I had a phone call with him and he was down, but then because we had the ad in it, it created like red tape because he was committed to other things, which yeah. So it was like a very surreal thing to be talking to key and just hearing his voice. And he was like, okay, yeah, I like this. And I'm like, whoa, this is fucked up. And then, you know, unfortunately, it didn't pan out. But we noticed that a good video. But yeah, that whole. And then we almost had, we almost had Courtney Cox in the video for Daddy. Really? Yes. We've almost had a lot of great kids. I've never quite pulled through for music videos at least. Yeah. I mean, we've had some pretty great guests. Yeah. I pitched John Cena for Daddy. Yeah. Didn't hear back from his agents. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And then we got like experimentation. And when it comes to, I guess early days making a decision to try something and stop it, how maybe the have those stakes increase now that you have DMG studios or just like the stuff you guys have built. Like you experimentation gets harder when you have overhead, right?\", 'Personal projects vs TMG': \" Yeah. And you have payroll and people or like a mortgage and you're like, yeah. Well, I could experiment or I can just do the thing that works. I think we tend to do it on our individual channels. Yeah. We are working on some stuff though. And we, but yeah, but I guess like it's a two part answer. So we are working on stuff between us. But because now we have to factor in the network and how that plays out like it's a much harder thing to pull the trigger on. Yeah. We definitely have to have deeper conversations about, okay, how does this impact the money? We also don't want to do anything that impacts our ability to support the other shows that we have want to make sure they're taking care of. So there's that aspect of it. And then so I think it's easier sometimes when we individually are like, I wonder if this will work and we can try like some version of it. And then we can almost like proof of concept, some idea and then we can bring that to the network as well. So I think we have two avenues for that still got it. I was just going to say I think we're also pretty good at like taking calculated risks. Yes. Yeah. I think that's like just starting on Patreon as a good example. Like that allowed us to fund the podcast in the beginning and then get a studio and make those take risks with our content and stuff like that and try different things because we knew we had a little bit of a safety net in terms of. And we're good at doing that now. It's like we're never going to stop the main money maker as the podcast. But as long as that's going, then we can mess around with Cody and Noel Dues and try moment house shows and like really try to develop new formats. Yeah. Do you guys talk about or do you have to talk about like how you're going to experiment personally or you're always aware of that just in case you're like, you know what? Actually that would be good if we do it on TMG. Yeah. Not really because I feel I don't feel anything is really sacred anymore unless you know start some extremely unique series to yourself. But I think if you're just throwing out general premises, I think it doesn't matter because I did like this entire game show that no one gave a shit about and it's fine because we just repurposed a lot of it. I thought that was funny. Oh, thanks dude. Yeah, I remember that. I was great. Well produced. Thank you. Yeah. But in doing that, it was dope because I learned so much and then I was able to just say, oh, we could repurpose this aspect for like a Cody and Well do or, oh, let's do this concept and I know it'll work because we worked on these things peripherally and we can adapt it into that. So when it comes to like the stuff we do together, it's always going to be unique because it's just us too. Yeah. You know, even if Cody does some video concept by himself, if he does it with me, it's automatically different. So yeah, I don't think that anything is like super awful. Or it's never a situation of like, you fucked it. If we just did it together and instead of by yourself, you know, it would have worked better. It doesn't matter. Was it ever a point where we're can together where you guys felt like your identity was so wrapped up in two of you working together? It's too late for that. Just too late. Because I feel like for us, it's that way 100%. Our brand is not, it's our names. Yeah. Yeah. I think we're at that point to a certain extent, where certain people only know the stuff that we do together and forever will get comments on our individual channels that is like, where's the other guy? Yeah, yeah. The other guy's like, comparison all that shit. But we're also pretty careful in maintaining our own individual stuff. It's like a sanity thing. It's like we're both creatives. So if we don't have a medium outside of TMG to experiment and work on our own stuff, I think we'd both go insane. Yeah. Yeah, because I think you, that's a weird thing that people don't, I think, really see, is that when you do a lot of work with a creative partner, like every aspect of the business, if it's doing well, starts to squeeze you two together into everything. Like, you know, then before you know it, like every brand wants you to only work together and everyone's only pitching you to work together. And you go insane because you have to have your own sense of self. Like that is super crucial. I mean, that's just like a basic thing in life. You need time to yourself. And I think the same holds true for your work. So yeah. Yeah, I think it comes across with you guys too, which I really respect and think, like, no, while you're short film. Oh, thanks, man. You know, like flipping that on on YouTube and you're just like, whoa, this is a total, this is just a creative expression. That's, it's just, if you say you, you openly like sabotage yourself on YouTube in a, in a potentially YouTube algorithmic sense. Yeah. But from an artistic perspective, it's really enjoyable to watch your channel and see a new format that's comedic and then a music video for you. So I think it is interesting whether the platform rewards it or not. Yeah, it doesn't. It doesn't, it firms. Confirm that too. Yeah. But we, like, we're terrified of experimentation. Yeah. We appreciate it. So I would say like we are, it's like a scary thing to experiment. Yeah. Especially when you build a business around something that it's like working. Yeah. And I was curious, Cody, you talked about that a bit around, well, mainly around like some of the challenges\", 'Cody Ko on creating uninspired work': \" of creating YouTube videos and maybe feeling uninspired or not as inspired to me. Yeah. I don't want to put words in your mouth here. But I think that's something like a channel you're at least responding to. I'm one of your streamers. Are you saying my videos all right? Is that what you're saying? No, yeah. No, it's definitely something that I've been feeling lately. I think like we both go through those, definitely. Zones where it's just like this whole world is up and down and up and down. You know, and there's some moments where it's just like, fuck, I just, everything I do feels dry. It feels like it doesn't have a soul or a purpose. And I think I'm a big fan of like momentum. And when it feels like something's working that really excites me like, like that I like it, but also other people like it. And you know, for a while, I just like wasn't finding that. And that's those moments where you have to sit back and just reevaluate and be like, well, it's just because I'm doing the, I'm doing the same thing and expecting different results. Right. It's like, but that's also what YouTube, like you're expecting a different emotional result. But like from, but as Tony and his member, it's like, I, I can only watch someone do one thing for so long. And that's like four years, you know? That's the period where it's like, okay, if this guy doesn't grow or evolve to the next thing or find something else, like I'm gonna fizzle out as an audience member, which you see happen all the time.\", 'The absurdity of YouTube': \" And I think that's one of the reasons why we've been able to like, you know, survive this long in this industry is because we keep trying to things and we keep evolving and learning and trying to better ourselves as, you know, creators. How much of what's happening on YouTube at large affects the decisions you guys make, like in your personal content on TMG, we were talking yesterday again about, it's hard when you look at YouTube and someone who's brand new will upload a video that's like, I traveled to every country in the world and that's their first video. Like that's the fault. Like that's the fault about it. Yeah. We talk about it a lot because like, we're, you know, we're having these conversations, like I said amongst ourselves about, you know, new formats for TMG and experimentation. And then we're, but we're like, what the fuck do we do? Because all of a sudden this, I see this video from this kid and it's like, I went to every Gordon Ramsay restaurant in the world. Yeah. This is like his fourth YouTube video ever. He must have spent 50 grand on it and then he edits it down to like four minutes. Yeah. How the fuck are we supposed to compete with that when that's the new bar of success on YouTube? Oh, bar car, man. You know? Yeah. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I've been saying it for years. Yeah. Let's blow up a car. No one's on the same team for years. Yeah. No, I think, well, I couldn't have talked about this before in our podcast, but the way I kind of boiled it down, which I think is really funny is everyone is speedrunning their YouTube career. So they're doing this really intense concepts right away. Yeah. And you can only visit so many restaurants all over the world, so many times. Before Cafe. Yeah. What did I just say? Great. Just on a TV. That's fine. But I do think there is something to be said about how the algorithm is motivating absurdity. Before it used to be like, look at this goofy movie that I saw. Now it's like, I watch every movie from this director. Now, you know. And it's on me. I was like someone's eye. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think it's necessarily sort of interrupt, but I don't think it's necessarily the algorithms fault. It's just because people are so much shit that that's what you've seen everything. Wow, this is something new. Yeah. Yeah, people have seen everything. So that's where, yeah, I think it comes down to doing crazy shit. Like that's really all that's left. Like some of the ideas I've come up with for us, the two of them are like, oh, how the fuck do we pay for that? I'm like, we find a way. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's really funny. I just have to say guys, I said blow up a cart. I didn't even say it. Cody said it twice now. Right. And the way they smiled, I'm just saying. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just saying. And again, like this is serendipitous that we have a car for you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It really is. Yeah. I think we manifest a bit more. I think this is the lead out to this moment. I think the biggest key to our career is actually this book called The Secret. I don't know if you've heard it. We just manifest it being a media executive. Right. Right. That's how we did. Yeah. But you know what? One genre that feels like it's still kind of holding strong or like a lot of it has been, like it's not as crazy is the commentary genre. Like the reaction. Yeah. It's like Drew Goodin or Jarvis Johnson. Yeah. Yeah. There's something, especially Drew, it's like for me, I find it's own enjoyable to just sit and listen to his like kind of intellectual analysis of something. But even his videos have gotten a little bit crazier. Like when he's buying every ad on Instagram, that's the series that's hitting. Like that's a, that's a, you know, comparison idea. Yeah, compared to sitting at a computer and reacting to something. Yeah. That's not way way to it. It's like you can tell how much effort he put into that and money too. Like he's buying a business, you know? What? For the Ninja Dio. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Everything on YouTube is going that direction. So I think it's going to be very interesting to see where things go. Even with, even with TikTok, I think it's funny that there's this youth that speedrunning all of the, especially with TikTok. Yeah. All the styles of content. Yeah. You know, that to me is the same as like when Nio laid back and like they, like plugged in the check in his head and they're like, and he goes, now I know Kung Fu. That's what these kids are doing. They're laying down and I like watching TikTok and they're just rolling their eyes in their head. They're getting like decades of sketch comedy injected in their brain over 12 months. Yeah. Plus like vlogging, plus everything. Yeah. Food tutorials, like everything. They're, they are getting way too much internet in such a short period of time. So I'm always curious to see where these people net out in like two or three years. I was wondering what it will do to society when like you're in high school and you've consumed so much about like entrepreneurialism, about going to college. Like how do you even go to college when you, like you feel like you've lived it all? Like you've seen everything. Yeah. It's like it's a DMT. That's how it's left. That's right. I don't know. I think it's a, it's a weird future that we're about to live in. I think even your guys videos are like obviously they've progressed significantly from you guys sitting and watching stuff. And it's a complex, the concepts are complex. You're like the out of touch concept. Yeah. Yeah. You're next for that by the way. That was a really funny concept. Oh, that was great. Yeah. That's a really good, because we get to play along too. Yeah. I got to play along with you. That was really fun. Yeah. Thanks, man. Yeah. Your edits are incredibly complex. Like the way, you're, Did you watch the ukulele video that I did? Yeah. That was like my first like, adventure into this world of like, okay, I'm going to try an idea that's bigger than just be sitting at a desk. Like I got to like set a goal and try something. But I don't want to spend $20,000 on it. So yeah, we're definitely, no dude, spending 20k for 100,000 views. Yeah. Yeah. You should do it sometimes. It's really fulfilling, it's really rewarding. Really rewarding, yeah. And then to have someone comment, Oh, well, look this guy fucking complaining. How hard is it? Because this guy acts like it costs so much. Exactly. Yeah. Well, continue, continue, sorry. The best is also in YouTube, like, doubles down on it. And they give you a 10 out of 10. And then there's like a line of copy that's like, your viewers have no interest in this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You try to achter their ass. They just, they just squeeze lemon on the wound. Yeah. Yeah. Have you considered being more interesting? Yeah. Yeah. Maybe quit. Yeah. I don't think YouTube's for you actually. Yeah. It's like five. It just has like a road. Yeah. Like three 10 out of 10s. I should have like a resume builder that pops up. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fill one of these out. Yeah. Try and maybe we thought we dug up your old LinkedIn profile. I mean scouted some careers. I might be able to do a video where you look for new jobs. Yeah. Yeah. Do you think that back to TMG studios like podcasting is a format for you guys\", 'Why podcasts?': \" investing in like not not suggesting building like a network of YouTube creators but building a network of podcasts and yeah. Podcasts has that held a little is that held a little bit more sacred than like the pace at which things are moving on YouTube and in social versus like Joe Rogan's been podcasting for how many years like is that is it a more stable creative environment that audiences are like yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But thanks. Yeah. I think this is something that again like we weren't super intentional about in the beginning it was like podcasts is working for us. Got it. It's really lucrative. So it would make sense for the for the first thing that the people do that we sign is to do a podcast because we know the world so well. Yeah. We already have these relationships where we can monetize it. So this makes sense. Right. Yeah. But now we're in this interesting place where it's like you know we're really good at making video podcasts. Yeah. It is it is somewhere where it feels like YouTube is moving more in that direction like you just see these for sure. Our long live streams from people where it's just a full on show. It seems like more and more of those are coming out and people enjoy watching those longer form video just unscripted. But now we're in an interesting place where like if that's the first move that we make and they're building an audience on their own then they can start to do kind of whatever like more short form YouTube videos. You know sketches if they want and we'll produce them. Yeah. So I think that's kind of an interesting future that we're sort of looking towards is is yeah we're signing podcasters but we're really signing creatives who really believe in and just giving them a platform to do whatever they want. Yeah. Outside of a podcast you know. You guys open and talking about like the terms of a deal when you bring a new creator in.\", 'Why TMG Studios is different than other networks': \" I always think it's interesting when like creators build a network because they have the perspective of what it would be like if they went in themselves. I mean these things that are important. It's tough to go into like a super niche detail. The thing is we actually kind of extrapolate parts of that to other people because we want to maintain the creative relationship with the people there. So we some of those conversations we do leave between like their people and our people kind of thing. I think the only thing we try to do is we do have aspects of the contracts or the agreements that we help build and we're really keen on just making people happy. Yeah. We because we've been on the other end where people offer us some pieces of deal and we're like it's like fuck you man like you don't even respect like what like me is a person building up what I've built and then bringing it to you. You know I'm not bringing it to you for you to just fucking cannibalize it and like ruin me. So yeah that's kind of been our motivation with like trying to you know build sets and create like a visual aspect that feels very you know like oh when you come here to do your show we like we care and there's going to be energy put into that. I think that's like the most important part of this next chapter of networks and media companies is that you guys have spent years and are continuing to spend years making the stuff like yeah it's highly unlikely that some of these the exact media executives at Quibi made short form content. So like even like executives at YouTube they don't make YouTube videos right so a lot of people who like when they were making decisions on YouTube originals like yeah they're just kind of they didn't know what works on YouTube because they never felt what it's like to be true film themselves and put it out like they don't know that experience. I think the empathy from a creative yeah for me if we're gonna sign with with anyone like I want it like when we got to sit down with the retineling you hear from them and you're like oh you know what this is like yeah that's true yeah you know way more what this is like than we know you know you've you've done this and I think that's a lot of the value when you look at young creators looking at TMG yeah it's like yeah they know they know what I feel like they know what it's like to press upload or to you know yeah there's that and like we also are really really keen on because you know not it's not to shade anybody but we see other podcast networks and their whole racket which is get as many people in here and pump them all to the same studio and let's see what sticks and I just think that's such a diss to the people who have built up what they built and you're just forcing them to you know oh yeah create this thing that you love in this extremely sanitized vanilla space that you can't affect your own none no this is great yeah it's like no no this is like there's not nothing the wall so no I mean to more like just sticking creators like onto like a table or like two chairs of the television and maybe I just thought your logo up there it's fine Yeah, you know, I think we like it's an assembly line. It's like I like that you call it like they like they we've never heard that term in a long time. Yeah, racket. Yeah, like a gangster movie. That's why they were new word. I love the idea of podcast network racket. Yeah, yeah. Everybody's a racket. So I think no, I mean, I'm a very I'm a very I tend to be very jaded about things. So when you zoom out like you mentioned that you know some of your day to day and the problems you're facing, you're trying to solve the problem in front of you, but trying to have that that zoomed out vision on where you headed. Where what is that? Like what is the zoomed out vision on where TMG studios is headed? I think I think we I think ultimately it's it's tough to say because we're\", 'The Future of TMG, Cody Ko and Noel': \" still experimenting. But I think the the ideal goal is that we have a roster of people that are just providing like really good entertainment and the the money that people are paying they feel it's the exchange is yeah is worth. I think and we want to enable them to to like yeah, you know reach their full potential. Yeah, and and do more like we can bring people on as podcasters, but if out of that they say hey, you know, is it possible to get some funding for this type of content or you know, we want to try these different avenues. We want to be in a position where we can green light stuff like that and just build like a nice ecosystem of just, you know, just creative people. I think that's but that's even like one to two years. Yeah, I think we're on our way to doing that. Yeah, hopefully I think five to ten years is like it would be really cool for us to be running, you know, a bigger scale media company where we're, you know, buying the rights to movies and making making those, you know, it's not just podcasts. I think podcasts are really great starting point. Yeah, I think we're going to take that really seriously. Yeah, for as long as we can, but I would love to scale outside of that niche and, you know, it would be cool to run like a full scale media company. Does that align with you guys creatively too? Like as TMG. Yeah, things like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, obviously there's been music. We're working on stuff right now. Yeah, cool. Yeah, yeah. That's not same vein. So that's really cool. Yeah,\", 'The TMG custom site': \" because I was curious about like, okay, you bring on another show like you guys are working really well as like you've built this model where you have a Patreon, but you guys actually like custom built this site and when it launched to be honest, I was like taking it back by it. Well, it's like, well, shut up. Fourth one. Yeah, yeah, yeah, those guys are really impressive. Yeah, they're impressive. Yeah, I mean, they're they're amazing. Yeah. When they reached out, you know, immediately the relationship around the bat was just like, I don't know, they were like just so generous. Yeah. Like they're like, hey, we, you know, and again, it was like it was like a creator first sort of mindset where he was like, I have, I know, you know, what you're looking for and we will build this site for you. You know, all you need to do is try to convert some people on. We were like, absolutely. We'll do that because it makes sense. Like it would just align with our vision. Like we wanted to end up in a place where we had multiple shows on one platform. Yeah, we could have done that on Patreon, but you know, it wouldn't have been branded. Yeah, I think that's the main thing. The way that they made down the weeds and create features that teams you studio.tv listeners really want. And I'm sure the best part about your new site is that you don't know fourth wall was involved. Yeah, that to me as a fan of you guys. I'm like, oh, I feel like I'm in my own space with you guys. To be fair, they they pretty much are because fourth wall is just kind of supplying like a code base, but like at the end of the day, we we have so much control over like, hey, can we add this feature and hey, can we enable this for people when they comment? And it's a very, you know, it's a great relationship because we get to give them good ideas. They get to give us good ideas. So in that way, I'm sure what we're developing for us isn't one to one with other people. And so it does end up feeling like this very personalized experience, which is really dope. It's cool. Yeah. Is the, and that was tmgstudio's.tv is the way I want to show it out or was that take that. That's Joel Park. Okay. It gets me every time. Is the is the immediate like next step for TMG more shows or is it like more creative with the current cast of of characters in the current world? Yeah. Yeah, that's the next step. Yeah. Should we stop there? Yeah. It's a it's a mixture. I do, you know, not because I sleep next to her, but I do have to quickly shout out my fiance, Alina. She's she's helped us at many stages, like kind of, you know, directly kind of through me or like in meetings with us, she'll kind of throw ideas out. She's been really helpful in the way of like, you know, sometimes I'll sit there and I'll the fuck me and Cody like need like a new type of concept. She has like a lot of production experience like she used to produce for Apple and so she's been really helpful in the way of like, oh, if you guys want to try this, I will produce it for you. And so that has been greatly helpful in figuring out, okay, what things do we do next? Like the thing we shot last week, I'm really stoked on that. Can we talk about it? Yeah, let's just talk about it. Let's do it. We're gonna. Yeah. It's gonna be so we're like, we're gonna do a moment house show and we essentially she helped like produce a fucking mashup of like survivor, the challenge and what else would it be? It'd be like a little bit of a, it's mostly those two, but I love the challenge. Yeah, yeah, yeah. She produced an original show. They used to be like a mix of these things. Yeah, because we like contestants. It's kind of because what it started with is Cody and I were like, we want to chew on something different, but we don't, we want to do it our way. And you know, so I was talking to her and she was like, well, you know, people like it when you guys interact, like, but they like it when you compete clearly because of all the Cody and well do stuff we do. And then she was like, uh, what if you did like a weird like challenge mashup? Because we watch a lot of the challenges, well, I'm like, oh, fucking, I know me and Cody would love that shit just because we're naturally a little bit competitive. Yeah. You know, we're a little bit, yeah, we try to be athletic. And then, I mean, this guy, 12 years experience, yeah, I don't want to sit on his, it isn't Olympian right here, dude, but Olympic hopeful. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hopefully the Olympics will realize what the fucking missed out on. Exactly. But yeah, so we shot that out last week and it was, I mean, that's some of the most fun we've had shooting in a minute. And it fully opened up this world where we were kind of like, dude, we could go to V2 against other people. We could make this a total shootout where it's me, Cody, and then four other people competing all against each other. I mean, there's so many ways you could slice it. And we did it all in our own studio. And it, go ahead. I was going to say, that's what's great about these moments of like kind of dry, like, what's next, what's next is that it leads to these moments where it's like, oh, fuck, it's like the ideas are, you know, running through your head. And it's like, we could, we should do five of these just us, but then we should also have other YouTubers in on this. And this could become this whole other thing. It's like, yeah, you know, that's, I love moments like that. You know, you're in a ebb and then all of a sudden you reach this flow state. Yeah. So I think that's like, in terms of next steps, I think that's really what dictates our next steps is we kind of draw on the resources around us. We like, we kind of start with our gut and we say, this is getting stale or we need to, you know, hey, we kind of need to refresh this idea that we've done in the past. Like, Cody and I will do is we love over like, maybe people want to see another version of us fucking around. That's kind of where it all stems from. That's cringles us fucking around. Cody and I will do is completely us like, you know, we're being told how to work out and we're not listening or pretending to break our fucking ankles, whatever. And then this now can be us like fucking with each other, but it's still entertaining. I mean, eventually host your own version of love island. Yeah. Oh, don't give me sorry. But no, no, no, no, they just don't just we've, we had a bit back in the day. We wanted to call it the influencer peninsula. And yeah, stick a bunch of them on. I've got it, whatever. But I think that's how we kind of, you know, that is how we dictate next steps because now that we have this great new concept that we can work on and build on, now we can say, okay, let's, we can build this into this show. And then it does well there. Okay, maybe let's extrapolate it or expand it and make it larger. Now we do it with, you know, other YouTubers or whoever, try to maybe draw some celebrity talent into it and make it bigger than us. I think it, it, I think a general theme is that everything we work on now is, I think we see a little bit more into the future. So unlike with that's cringe, we're kind of like, oh, let's just make a video. I think now we do think more in the realm of like, okay, if we do this, is it repeatable? Yeah. And how expansive can we make it? Sounds like you're thinking like, I'm meeting. I feel like this podcast was just like you guys going through a self discovery of recognizing you are now immediately executive. Kind of, yeah. Yeah, I'm definitely, I gotta buy a suit. Yeah. I'm definitely like reluctant to admit it sometimes. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's funny. Alina will have to tell me she's like, you and Cody are like doing a lot. I'm like, it's whatever. Yeah. Yeah. We're just, it's fine. Yeah. We just want to make great stuff. Yeah. Yeah. And we want to put people on. Like it feels good that like, you know, Ben and Emil and Connor and Brooke have this amazing platform now. Not that they didn't before. You know, obviously TikTok's awesome. But like, you know, they were able to give them this new format and the signature platform and, you know, let their minds run wild with whatever they want to do. You know, and we have some talent coming up that we're signing right now that we're really, really thrilled that they get those opportunities as well. Yeah. Bill, Bill, it feels good. It's really dope feeling. Yeah. I'm working with them. Yeah. Like it's great that, you know, we signed someone and then all of a sudden we're shooting a video for a moment house show or for Team G studios and we're like, we get to film a sketch for them, like the cult sketch that we did for Team G studios. Yeah. That was great. Yeah. That was, that was like a moment where I felt, like, I felt the universe. Yeah. Oh, this is talent as a part of TMG. And now every time we come up with an idea where we're like this game show thing, for example, or anything else, like a sketch or whatever, like for the moment house show, we had, you know, we were like, well, we need someone to come in and pretend they just got their arm eaten by a tiger and that person was Ben. Yeah. Because like anything that we do now, we're like, oh, let's, we have this talent. Yeah. Talent. Let's put them in and then it becomes something great. Yeah. Especially for people from TikTok, that's a huge service. Yeah. Because it's extremely difficult to go from TikTok to having anything long form. Yeah. And that's where you can sustain the business. Yeah. It's very true. I want to just shout out to, you know, we talked, I think this is the first time we, we've really like really delved into like the business. Yeah. So I just would be remiss if we didn't shut out everyone that works for. Yeah. It was also like was odd our representation. Yeah. You know, everyone, we have incredible teams and support systems around us, our fiancees. Definitely. So yeah, definitely wouldn't be where we are without them. And if you want to work for Team G Studios, you can email jobs at TeamG Studios.tv. Yeah. That'll be on the jobs at TeamG Studios.tv. And if you have a podcast idea that you want produced podcasts at TeamG Studios.tv. Well, on that note, like if people are, there's going to be people who are watching this who want to pitch you guys a podcast. Yeah. What makes a good podcast pitch for you guys? Does it have to be comedy? Like what's the problem? No, I think we were open to anything. Could it be like a multi-cultural duo who talks about like entrepreneurship and the yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Could it be. Yeah. Yeah. We we excel. We excel in one white guy and one ethnic leave a combo. We excel in that kind of\", 'How to work for Cody Ko \\\\u0026 Noel Miller': \" word. It's a good combo. Yeah. It presents a lot of opportunities. Yes. Yeah. It does. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You open up both sides. Yeah. There's the comfort of Colin and the exotic nature of me. Yeah. Yeah. And you're deemed safe next to Colin. Right. I've literally said that though before. Yeah. It's good that you're a paramount because I'm yeah. Yeah. That's it's harder. All right. If you're in an ethnically direct relationship. Yeah. But are there any other outside of that? I don't want to do a true crime show. Yeah. But like some funny angle on it. We have to be comedy but make it unique because there's so many true crime shows right now. Yeah. But I yeah, I really want to do that. That feels like just like a winning formula. How does like podcasting revenue break down? Like,\", 'How TMG Studios makes money': \" you know, between I guess membership, ad sense, brand deals, our brands of deals still part of that, like a significant part of that world. Like how do you guys look at that? Yeah. I mean, with the ad reads that we do, it's it's all I would say obviously are our subscribers. Those are the people that we really put at the front in terms of priorities because they're the ones listening every week. They're you know, paying every month. We want to make them happy. To what website? TMGStudios.tv. Okay. Got it. Yeah. Yeah. And which you know, you and you can learn more by just going to TMGStudios.tv. Right. About the service that we offer. And then you actually don't, you know, we'll do ad reads but those aren't you don't hear those on TMGStudios.tv. You know, that's just a completely, you know, the episodes are ad-free on TMGStudios.tv. Yes, they are. There's actually other ones. There's bonus content on TMGStudios.tv. Yeah. Yeah. Just surrounded by media executions. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Corporate America. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But, uh, yes, you know, those brand deals and then ad sense, we don't prioritize that or like we don't concern ourselves with it too much. Um, it is, it is important. Yeah. But, um, podcasts, podcasts-wise, we don't make that much ad sense. But when we do a code, you know, I'll do, we make decent ad sense money. Yeah. Not enough. Like they, they cost it, it costs a decent amount to produce those. So, usually with ad sense, we'll break even or make a little bit of money on ad sense if we do a code and we'll all do nowadays. Before we used to make a ton of money, but like they get less views now. So we kind of break even and then if we do a brand deal, that's when we, like in that video, that's where we actually profit. Yeah. We got it. Yeah. It's interesting. Do either of you guys like live in your YouTube studios or do you guys not really care about those? Like just check your analytics all the time. I check it pretty often. Check it often. Uh, I just try to remain sane. Yeah. So I, I had to delete it off my phone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was like, I don't, I don't need to know. Yeah. I just upload and I just either ask Alina or my production assistant, Alina manages a lot of my YouTube stuff. So I'm like, is it good? She's like, yes. And I just go, no more, no more. It's just us now. Yeah. Were there any like, oh,\", 'Partying with Elon Musk': \" shit moments collectively with you guys, whether it was a deal for a certain amount of money or like a milestone in your career, like a cultural moment, whether it was like on hot ones or something like that, any moment where you to like reflect back and it was just at the time, like a holy shit type of thing. I think the biggest those shit moments still was being an Elon Musk party house. Yeah. Yeah. That was like, yeah, actually, it was, yeah. Or when we like went and went to Europe with Post Malone, and yeah, recorded a podcast episode with them and went to like five of his shows, and then like that was a pretty wild, like few weeks. But yeah, when we were actually in the Elon Musk's house, yeah. And there was a moment like after we left where we were both like sitting on the curb, like children, like waiting for an Uber at 4 a.m. outside of Elon Musk's house. And we were just like, what the fuck just happened? How did you get invited to Elon Musk's house? One of Post Malone's high school friends introduced him to that's cringe. And then he just followed us on Twitter. And he just DM, he just DMed us. And then I was like, I appreciate the follow man. He just sent me his number. And he was like, let's hang out. I'm okay. So he put us in a thread. He was flying back from tour. He touches down in LA. We go meet him at a bar. We're hanging out. And then he goes, don't we go to Elon's? And we laugh. We're like, and he goes, yeah, let's go. And we're like, okay. He's like, I'm texting him right now. We're like, he just, he just turns his phone to us. Sure. Yeah. It's like it's true enough. It's like Elon Musk. And we're like, what? Oh, this is for real. You actually want to go to, he's like, yeah, let's go right now. Yeah. And yeah, we pulled up to his house and him and Grimes were standing on the driveway. Just like with lanterns. Yeah. Kind of checking out. Yeah. Yeah. That checks out. Yeah. That's super strange. Five. Yeah, it proceeded to be a very, very weird night. A P to one of the bathrooms. And I took a picture of me in the mirror. Like, I'm pissing in Elon's bathroom. You hung out for a minute. And then it got to a point where we were like, it's time to go. Yeah. Yeah. We go. It's like, where are you? We're at Elon Musk's house. It's hard to explain. Yeah. Yeah. And then before I am, we're waiting for an Uber just laughing. Like, what the fuck? Yeah. That's a wild moment. Weird. Really. I think you talked about Cody. Also like Jack Harlow at one point, starting to you and being like, like being a fan of the content. Is that, is that like more, did you talk about that? Yeah. I mean, we had, uh, texted because I've been a fan of his music for a long time. Yeah. Um, and so we somehow we like started, I don't even know how we like met or started talking initially. But I think I don't even know how, but we used to text and send DMs back and forth and stuff like that. And then, um, I did this like TikTok, like making fun of the one of the lines and his new song. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I got some echo chill and he was like, Oh, I mean, I saw that TikTok and I was like, Oh, fuck. Yeah. Is that cultural impact? They're like crazy that these like, I don't know, like, I think that's more, I think that's just a testament to the power of TikTok more than it is. Yeah. Our impact. You know, I think it's just like, if you make a TikTok about something, chances are, or somebody chances are they're going to fucking see it. He's got it. Everyone sees it. You know, yeah. I mean, um, it was cool when we went to Louisville. Uh, Jack put us in touch with like some of his childhood friends. Yeah. Yeah. That's where we're friends with his like immediate group of people. We have to talk to him in a, in a while. Yeah. That's a huge blue ace two for one. You know, uh, if you have to see this, um, yeah. Now they, uh, they, we hung out with them and, and uh, but yeah, Jack's been nice to us. Mm-hmm. He didn't follow either of us after you climbed them. So, okay. That's good. I think he actually thought it was funny because he was like, I thought that was funny. I was like, thanks. Yeah. He walked off with nine bodyguards. All right. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks.\"}, {'MrBeast on increasing retention': \" Like if it's not, then it just wasn't a good enough video in my opinion. Right. I mean, even the videos we did that were your most viewed videos could be way better. Right. What do you think gets us to a million subscribers? Well, subscribers is an arbitrary. Okay. So a million views. No, you should ask me what helps us make the best views possible. Okay. So you guys should ask me subscribers don't matter views don't matter. I mean, they do. Yeah. But all that comes, everything you want as a creator comes from making the best videos possible and thumbnails. But it's easier to, you know, make thumbnails. The video parts, the hard part and that's the thing that you're known for. No one's known for having no one's like the biggest YouTube in the world because they have the best thumbnails, right? It's also because they have great phenomenal content. You know what I mean? Like that's the hard part that very few people do well. And that's what people remember. You know what I mean? You're not going to have some random dude when you're walking down the street of Paris go like, yo, that's the guy with the great thumbnails. You know, they're going to be like, no, that's the guy with the phenomenal videos that whatever, you know, held his breath for 40 minutes underwater or things like that. So that's a tip for you guys. But also you guys watching ask how can I make my videos better? Do that every single day for years. And then you'll probably get views. I feel a lot like if we put out a video and we're frantically changing thumbnails afterwards, we're already way too far gone. Like, not that it doesn't help to change your packaging, but I know when we have a really good video. Like I know it's really good and the title and the thumbnail. If you want a video and you're not like, you're not like, this is a banger, this is going to bang no doubt in my mind. Even though you're going to be wrong 9% of the time, then it's not a good enough video. You still have to have that feeling even if you should have spent more time thinking about that. Like the audience tell you you're wrong. Don't put it out when you already know you're wrong. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. You know, because you have some videos you have in our fun. Well, if it's 10 out of 10, yeah, and it did worse than your other 9 videos. And it's like, okay, but you have videos you don't even upload sometimes. Definitely. I mean, you just, the thing is like, it's a lot harder for us because like what we're doing are big productions of those span of months, things get distorted. I visualize the giant amount of money and this and someone scooping it up in a tractor and then you do it. And it's not as epic. You're like, oh, this is kind of lame. You know what I mean? So it's just, I just watch it, honestly. And I just like, if there's ever a moment where I'm even slightly bored, I'm like, cut it. And if there's something where I'm not just like, wow, you know, like the whole time, then it's like, don't upload it. It's not good. And does it weigh on you at all that you're like, man, but we invested over 100 videos in my life. Like completely filmed. I've spent probably, I don't even want to pull number on it, but I'm godly about some money on videos in real life that don't get uploaded. I don't give a f***. Best video possible or get it out of my face. I don't care. What's the last video you did in Nuffload?\", \"MrBeast's hardest videos to make\": \" Well, this one is kind of on the fence. We're re-editing it. But if you never see it, then we did a video where we built like 10 sets and I built like 10 rep because of banks. It was robbed this bank. I'll give you $100,000. And then so like bank, vote number one, the boys had to break into the bank and whoever broke into the bank first got what was inside the vault's empty. And I'm like, so this vault's empty and some of the other vault's empty. But one of these vaults when you open it will get 100 grand. So they had to break into a bunch of banks and all of them were empty. And then after like nine ones, the tenth one, which they're like, none of these banks have the money in. They finally break in. I think I don't want to spoil it, but one of the boys broke in. And then they open it and there's $100,000 in cash. It's like, congratulations. You robbed the correct bank. And it's cool, but the sets were a little bland and the bits weren't as funny. And I didn't think it was as good as it could be. But hopefully, we're like on our twelfth at it. Hopefully this one maybe fixes some of the problems I'm having. What's the hardest video you've ever made, whether it came out on the channel or not? Oh boy. Oh, well, let's see. Oh God, Tariq, you have any inspiration throughout me? Yeah, I mean, I mean, team trees was, I mean, I enjoyed it, but that was, that was a ton, man. I mean, me and Mark Rover worked on that for like eight months leading up to it. I don't want to overestimate it. Maybe it was seven or six. And I was like, it started with me wanting to plant a million trees. And I was reaching out to all these YouTubers that do environmental stuff. And the gist was just like, you're crazy. You're like, this just isn't possible. You just can't plant a million trees. They're like, it takes like hours to plant like a hundred. And they're like, what are you thinking? And then I'm like, yo, Mark, can you build me something to plant trees? And like, some me and Mark are like scheming how to plant a million trees. And then I was closing it on 20 million subscribers. And I did like this thing where I gave my three-minute subscriber pennies, four-million subscribers like popcorn, five-million blah blah. And someone on Reddit was like, you should give your 20 million subscribers, or for 20 million subscribers you should plant 20 million trees. And I was like, Mark, I know a million is impossible, but get this. Let's plant 20 million trees to celebrate me hitting 20 million subscribers. And he's like, you're a f***ing idiot. And I was like, let's do it. And then we're like, you know, as we ran down the rabbit hole, we're like, there's no world where we're doing this. And then we're like, well, what if we gather all our fans? And we do like different events and plant them. And then we're like, nope, that would still only plant like 100,000. Like that won't work. And then we're like, like, okay, well, what if we pay people to do it? And then, or what if we do seed drives? What if we have our fans buy seeds? We sell seeds at cost. They buy it, they plant it in their yard, and then we do research for a month. And we're like, it's an innovation species. You could do more harm than good. I don't know if I trust 14-year-old Billy to understand whether or not they can plant that next to a pine tree. So then we're like, and we're going on for months on months. We're just figuring out how the hell we plant 20 million trees every week we're having calls. And then we, I don't remember how well we got connected with the Arbide Foundation. They've planted, like, I don't know the exact number, but I know it's over 100 million trees. They're experts. Like, this is what they do. And they're just like, yeah, we can plant a tree. They told us their cost and we were like, can you get it down to a dollar? And they're like, I mean, yeah, at scale, we could plant a tree for a dollar. And I was like, boom, there you go. And we were like, okay, all we need is $20 million and they can plant the 20 million trees for my 20 million subscribers. I'm already past 20 million subscribers at this point, but I'm like, fuck it. We're in too deep. And then now it's like, okay, how do we get 20 million dollars so we can plant 20 million trees? And then we just started figuring out slow again. It's like, there's so much stuff that never even made the internet like trick shot for trees. We were going to try to make a viral TikTok trend and get it where like you did a trick shot and if you missed, you had to donate $10 to plant 10 trees and then you had to challenge someone else like ripping off it. Yeah, less I spuck a challenge. And so we're developing this for like a month. And then we're like literally like testing it and then like I'm shooting a trick shot, donating trees. I'm challenging people like any fake videos and we're like roasting them. We're like, no, this isn't going to go viral. Like no one cares, right? And then we're just we're shopping all this. And then I don't know how we landed on it. And then we're just like, no, we're just going to get our audience to donate and we're just going to get every YouTuber we know to make videos on it. And we're going to just magically pray we don't only raise $500,000 and look like the biggest city at some planet. And so we somehow got a list. It wasn't from YouTubers. Like some company that does a lot of YouTube data, they sell to like media companies and they just gave us a list of like all the biggest YouTubers like on an Excel sheet. And Myanmar just like it took forever, man. We're just going down the list and I'd be like, do they follow you on Twitter? No. And we check our Instagram. We find some way to reach out to that creator or someone who follows us that follows them and we'll be like, hey, give us some contact. And we'd be like, hey, doing this thing. Make a video about trees, tell your fans every dollar they donate. Boom. And we went down this list, DMed over 1,000 of the biggest creators got hundreds of them to make videos on it. They all launched at the same time as our videos and like, and yeah, in the first day we raised millions of dollars and crushed our $20 million goal. The quote of the night is, all we needed was $20 million. That campaign wasn't the problem. That wasn't the problem. That is wild, man. There's so many, like literally it was six months to me just being in Mark. Mark more so than me. I'm of the kind of like, oh, let's do an intro, but Mark's like, every other day we'd have mental breakdowns where we're like, we're not going to raise $20 million. What are we crazy? We should do $2 million and I'd just be like, nah, let's do $20 million. I hit $20 million subscribers. Mark is a funny story. And then I would convince him. I'd be like, and also it's $20 million by 2020. It's a good slogan. And he's like, oh, well, if you put it that way, I guess we'll just keep you unrealistic goal. I mean, that was a big success though. That was huge. That was huge success. I mean, it is the biggest thing I've ever done. Yeah. I mean, literally not all 20 million have been planted. I think like 13, 12, 13, somewhere there has been planted. I think all of them, all 20 million will be planted by the end of next year. And yeah. I think that's a really good example of like, you make the best videos possible and then you can do anything. Like you do such interesting things. Exactly. You can plant 20 million trees. You could do that if you're making good videos. Yeah, but like, and the thing is like 99% of people even if you had that ideal, like, I mean, that was so much time, man. So much times and so many, like it started with a million. And it's like a half a year of just nonstop obsession and grinding and reaching out and learning and learning and learning and trick shot for trees and this and that all just culminating to that final end point. And like 99% of people would have gave up like they would have gone, I want to plant a million trees and someone would have gone, you could only plant a hundred and they would have been like, oh, well, it goes a good deal. You could do it. Do you think attention is the most valuable currency in the world? Well, of course. I mean, if you could post something in everyone in the world of watch that you'd be the most powerful man on earth. So of course. Simple question. Yeah. Just curious if you had that opinion. I do. Yeah. I have the same opinion. That's where that conversation ends. So what you did with Mark was really successful. Do you have plants that do something different with him? Yeah. And so a few days after the two-year anniversary of team trees or launching team sees, I don't want to give away too many spoilers. One dollar might get something out of the ocean. We'll reveal it then. But if you are a creator, which I know you guys have a lot of creators, so watch you. Hit me up or Mark Rover. Team sees is happening this year. We're going to try to raise more than 20 million dollars, which is terrifying. I need your help. I'm sick to my stomach thinking about it. You're going to raise one dollar for every grain of sand on the beach. Yes. Sure. That's the one. Team trees was definitely the biggest reaction that I remember. Yeah. Just global headlines everywhere. Elon Musk donated a million dollars. So we had this lead aboard. The more you donated, the higher up you got. So it would get like a ego match for people. So someone donated 100 grain and it'd be number one. And someone donated 101. And someone donated 200. And Elon Musk donated a million dollars to be number one, which I thought was cool. And then Toby from Shopify, which I love. Shout out to you. Super cool. Donate like a million and one dollars. So he took the swap from Elon and just sat up there. I thought that was funny. That's so good. I yo Toby, if you're watching this, when Tse's happens DM me, it'll be fun. We expect over a million dollars. We expect one million and two. Yeah. Even if you don't donate, it just be cool to get your thoughts on it. But over a million and two would be nice. So it was that we're doing just pure pressure. That's pure pressure. That every billionaire we write if you don't donate. I'm curious just if you, in terms of YouTube, I'm really curious your perspective on the vlogging format. Like creators like Emma Chamberlain. Like how do you think that plays into the concept of like she, I mean, her viewership is really significant. And sometimes she's just like at her house making coffee and making a peanut butter jelly sandwich. Like how do you think she captures that much attention? Well, I mean, it is entertaining. She's an actually funny person.\", 'MrBeast on Emma Chamberlain': \" And like that is a skill being, like I couldn't do that. Or if I did, like it wouldn't be so off the cuff. Like she, she's just an actually witty and funny person. Like Chris, in my videos, one of the wittiest people I've ever met in my life. Like you could just drop this gatorate bottle and he'd say something. I'd just make you laugh like crazy. And it's like, where did that come from? Right. But at the same time, you're limited by personality. Like she's doing well. She's, you know, top 1% of creators. But I mean, how many views a month? Like 40 or something? Like it's great. It's phenomenal. But it's like there's, she's tied down to her personality. If you don't like Emma, then you're not going to watch her videos. You know what I mean? And so there's only so big that can take you. And even if you do get super big, it's like literally just all on your shoulders. It's a lot of weight and a lot of pressure. So that is a lot of pressure. Because the product of the video is your personality. Well, yeah. Because if you're depressed or you're going through stuff, you know, it's harder to make videos, you know what I mean? But yeah, at the same time, like, you know, a lot of people just enjoy making that type of content. So yeah. That's true. Yeah. You need to be in a good mood to film a video. And you kind of say, you said, like, I don't really have a choice. Because if I don't, then I just burned half a million dollars. Yeah, on some videos here. But also your format lends itself that you don't always have to be in a good mood. Because like it's the story work that went in beforehand that ensures the reaction. Whereas like for Emma, she probably doesn't need to be in a good mood. Exactly. Like she does have to be in a good place for her personality. It's like two drastically different creators. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's almost like, do you try and take out a lot of those variables when you're planning a video? I don't know. I just do whatever I think will make the best video possible. I mean, I hate to always fall back on it, but that's the driver. It's just whatever I think will make the best video possible. Like if I thought telling people more about myself or being more personal and make the video better, I would do it. But I think most people, like for the most part, like they want to see me run for an FBI agent. They don't want Nick here. Me go, oh, also guys, tomorrow's my mom's birthday. You know what I mean? They're there to see me run from an FBI agent, you know what I mean? So.\", 'MrBeast on starting a podcast': \" But we did tweet about the Colorado podcast. Yeah. You replied to that tweet and you said, I'm starting a podcast. Yeah. There was a lot of people who are excited about that. They were like, people took it as a real headline. Yeah. There were some people who pressed out list that said, Mr. Beast announced his podcast. I mean, the only reason I would do a podcast is to make money to do big YouTube videos. So if I thought that I could make enough or make a difference, I'd be able to album my content. But it's just like that. It's happy. Study big YouTubers. It happens time and time and time again. They like, they get big. They start side projects. They lose focus. Their channel falls off and then all that stuff fades away with it. You know what I mean? You just got to be focused at the end of the day. That's what matters. Main channel, Mr. Beast and all this other stuff supports it. You know what I mean? Uh, right now when you download the YouTube app, your picture is on there. Yeah. Like you are on the Google Play Store. On a Play Store Apple Store. On the Google Play Store when you download YouTube, your picture is on there. How much do you interact with YouTube? Do you give them advice on YouTube? Not really. No. Do they reach out to you at all? I mean, at the end of the day, like, what am I going to tell? There are army of 100 people or 1000 people that work on this part of the thing that like, yeah, my five second thought of opinions better than their analysis. You know what I mean? No, I think they do a good job. I think they take responsibility. And I just, it's crazy that you, if you have 100 subscribers, you have five. If you upload a good enough video, it will get views. Like if you're not, you're just, I don't want to make such a definitive thing. Take this to the grand side. I don't, majority of the time, you're just not making a good enough video if it's not getting views. You know what I mean? If that's your goal to get views, obviously if your goal is not to give views, then who cares? You know what I mean? But you can get a million views on a video, even if you have 100 subscribers, if the video is good enough. You can. Promise. I've seen it happen a bunch. Next to YouTube, right under it, is there a platform that you like the most? Next to YouTube? No, I mean, I like them, but it's YouTube. YouTube is what I live and breathe. Take them all away. I don't care. I just want YouTube. YouTube is the future, in my opinion. I have television. It's the biggest. It's not going anywhere. It's the most dominant. And I just, I love YouTube more than anything. Why do you think it's so dominant? Like what makes YouTube? I told you, like Android. You know, come on Android phones. Google and it's just has such a deep catalog and there's so many people on it, has the best monetization program. Like, you know, YouTube's paid creators more than any other platform in history. You know, probably more than the other platforms combined. You know what I mean? And it's just, I love it. I love it so much. I don't know. I think the algorithm also promotes better storytelling. Like the barrier to entry of the title and the thumbnail. If you actually back up that title and thumbnail, it requires that you told a compelling story. I agree. And then when it comes down to retention, if you actually keep someone from zero to fifteen minutes, you've done a good job of telling a story. My problem when I load up YouTube on my TV is that there's too many videos I want to watch. It's gotten too good at recommending me videos that I see like foreign the top row and like the top, you know, top half of like another four. And I'm just like, I want to watch all of these. What do I do? What type of videos are those? Like, you know, probably be like how a US aircraft carrier gets food and I heard delivers mail, you know, air flight patterns of planes. And then this one will be like, how this random guy on Reddit turned $1,000 into a million and stuff like that. And then there's like the random like what Aristotle taught people in 10,000 years, whatever it goes, stuff like that. But yeah, it's always like, they're always so interesting and I know like, like, I'm going to watch most of these videos because I've watched thousands of videos on my account. So it's like, it knows what I'm going to watch and it's just like, it's so hard at this point for me. I don't know if other people have this problem. Like the algorithm's getting so good that I think they need to serve less videos because I don't, I'd stress me out. I'm like, which one do I pick? I want to watch them all. Is there an analytic that you wish you had?\", 'Analytics with MrBeast': \" The I would love to be able to see what a bunch. Which one do I say? That's horrible. I would love A8 to be able to do A, B testing, that's I think we all agree. Like that one I don't even know that would be second. I'd love to see like if someone, if someone watches selling houses for a dollar, right, they watch this video, they watch all the way into the end and I would love to be able to see like if they win and watch another video and another one, right? Or a better example would be like, like it did last sleep circle for 10 grand, right? I'd love to be able to see, okay, well, a lot of people who watch this when, then win and watch like last sleep slime and then actually you can see that. I just wish, I don't know, like, which there's this an easier way to show it. Like you follow because of your cards. You mean? Well, you can click on a video suggesting C which we will suggest it. I guess, yeah, I guess I'm just too lazy to dig through that. It just be cool to be able to see the viewing patterns of, but the more I'm speaking at the more I'm realizing there would probably be privacy concerns. Yeah. If you could follow a user. So, yeah. So, now I'm going to start back, like maybe that is. But you mean like an aggregate, like if it's said like, but it does kind of show you that. Yeah. Yeah. I guess I'm an idiot and that just disregard everything I just said there. The more I think about the dumber that was. So, there was a couple things on your financial statements that I found really interesting. Yeah. We're back in that. Yeah. Yeah. So, you loved the financial statements. Yeah. I loved it. That was my favorite. They're fun to talk about because no one's ever seen them before. Yeah. So, one of the parts of your financial statement was also merchandise. And I feel like it's not something we hear about that often with you. Unless it's like you're writing everyone's name on the wall. Yeah. How do you interact with that? Or does it interest you? I saw that it's like available in retailers. Yeah. We're in zoomies and that's going well. I don't know. I'm so obsessed with making the best feels possible. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, it's like I could make, I mean, ungodly amounts of money if I promote a merch every video, but I just don't want it. I just want to make the best feels possible. You know, so yeah, it's, it's not what it could be basically fraction of what it could be. If I should make most videos, I don't even mention merch. Imagine if I promote a merch every single video. You know what I mean? Yeah. I would sell a bunch, but I don't know. I just want to make the best feels possible. And I don't think promoting merch makes the video better. Sometimes they, but let me back put a little bit. Sometimes they do need to promote it because some videos cost over a million dollars and I don't do a million dollars per video and ad revenue. So, you know, yeah. All right. So, we did a YouTube money calculator to see how much money your channel has made in total and it's lifetime. Okay. Lifetime. Lifetime. Okay. The main channel. Okay. And so, that's often 12 billion views. 12 billion views. Okay. So, the number it gave us was 28 million dollars. So, it's assuming like a $2.3 RPM. Interesting. I mean, obviously I've spent tens of millions of dollars on my videos. So, the money has to come from somewhere. I won't leave it at that. You know what I mean? Okay. Yeah. Because you've spent more than that. Of course.\", 'MrBeast on spending a billion dollars': \" Yeah. I mean, tens of millions of dollars have gone into my YouTube videos. Like, because I've taken all the money from the gaming channel, the React channel, all the other stuff I'm doing on my merch, all the brand deals, everything. Gone right back into it. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, there's probably going to be a day where I'll spend over a billion dollars on just YouTube videos in the future. That's so crazy. Obviously, I'm nowhere near that. But I'm talking like, you know, two decades from now or a decade, yeah. Yeah. But in a year, you're spending lots more than I just said. Yeah. Way more funny than I said. I mean, like, some months first feel like four or five million dollars on videos, yeah. Yeah. So, crazy. I saw it in the financial system. Yeah. Yeah. That's a shock to you. Try lighting a soccer field or something, right? You kind of, like, I'm renting an NFL stadium. Yeah. Or any of that type of stuff. It's expensive. But, but alone, pay us videos. Yeah. As team guys. I don't want to get into that, man. It just, how many people work here? I don't know at the exact number. You know, because, you know, some people hire and I'll leave it a lot of, but I mean, it's a lot. Obviously, dozens of fun, dozens of people. I'll leave it open for interpretation. You guys speculate. Yeah. But, do you ever feel, you talked about like people always suggested that maybe you\", 'Does MrBeast get burnt out?': \" would get burnt out on YouTube? Do you ever feel burnt out like other times where you feel like tired? My definition might be different than others. You know, like, some people are like, I'm burnt out, screw this. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. You know, like, never, never at that point. But, yeah, like if, if I'm going like, you know, I go from time to get up to time, I go to bed like three days in a row, I'll be like, okay, like, kind of want to like take half a day off and like chill or like, I'll feel like coming and stuff like that. But, this is what I'm doing to the day I die. I don't care. Like, I love this more than anything. Nothing's ever brought me a fraction of the joy. What are the in between moments like for you when you're like buried alive for 50 hours? Like, because we don't see all of it. Well, you do. In between these things, we show time lapse, so you could see I was in there the whole time. But, I mean, yeah, still, you don't see your reaction. I don't see if you're enjoying it in the middle of it. I'll just point you to enjoy it. Here, let me just put this out there. I did not enjoy being buried alive. So we're all on the same page. My back hurt from laying on a wooden board for 50 hours. The thing is like, you know, sometimes I got a little claustrophobic and I'd be like,\", 'MrBeast on being buried alive': \" oh, God, I can't stand up if I wanted to. But I'd just be like, you know, we did our research. We tested it. We buried the box for like, you know, what was it? I tricked, you know, I don't care. Like five, ten days beforehand. Like, we did extensive research. So every time I'd be like, oh, God, I can't move. There's thousands of pounds of dirt on me. I could die. I'm like, nope, did the research trust math? I'm not gonna die. You know what I mean? I had to just remind myself multiple times. Like, nope, you're good. Because it was a see-through coffin. So it's different than just a normal one. Every time I look up, I just see dirt. And it's like just the only thing stopping that dirt from just suffocating me and collapsing on me is just this glass like this thick, you know? That's the only thing staying between me and whatever, like eight feet of dirt. So we were in one of your meetings yesterday. And it's for when you are coming videos. And they brought up that there are boa constrictors. And that boa constrictors were a real threat to this production to you. And that, you know, while they're not poisonous, they can crush your body in a matter of, you know, minutes. Yeah, exactly. So we'll keep the medic within a minute. So the discussion was around where the medic should be. How many medics we should have? Yeah, we're putting two medics stations. So they're close enough that they can stop me from getting killed by a boa constrictor. So have you developed an appetite for pain, for managing fear and discomfort? Well, I mean, we just a strategic. Like we don't ever do anything where I could die. Like, barely alive. There was a zero-present chance to anything would happen to me. Like we did our research, we hired consultants. We spent over a quarter of a million dollars spending that company. Like, there was no risk. I was probably safer down there than I was up above the ground. And like, genuinely, I mean that. I was safer in that box than if driving the car home afterwards. If you really think about it, just like when they say you're safer in a plane than you are driving a car. And so, you know, it's like, we don't leave anything up to chance. We're very tactical and we account for all that stuff. But like, opportunity to die is one thing that like, just discomfort, like feeling. Oh, with discomfort. Oh, with discomfort. Feeling claustrophobic. Getting really, really sunburned. It's weird. Like, when I count to 100,000 or even before that, I cut a table and half with plastic knives, which took, God knows, like, days. I'm just soling. Because I was in math class when I was in high school and I just like, I'd plastic knife in my pocket from lunch. I don't know why I put it there. And I just like, saw it a little bit. I was like, oh, well, you can cut a table and half, like on my desk. You can cut a table half with plastic knives and then, I just threw it away. And later that day, I was like, wait a minute. And then I just like, I ran to the store late at night and my mom's like, what the fuck are you doing? I'm like, just buying knives. She didn't know I was a YouTuber, like doing videos back then. And then I had no money or anything. But I just bought like $5 worth of plastic knives and I just grabbed one of our tables. So I just started cutting it. And I hit record and I was like, hey, guys, I'm going to cut this table and half of plastic knives. And then it's just like, I thought it takes like four hours, but like a dozen go by. I'm not even half way done. And I'm just like, cutting a table and half of plastic knives. I don't know why. It was so dumb. I think if I was your mom and I was watching a video of you watching paint dry, I'd be like, what is Jimmy doing? I know. I know. I know. I'm taking him on the back end of counting to a hundred thousand. Right. I right after I dropped out of college and had to move out. Good times. Yeah. He thought it was going crazy.\", 'Why MrBeast dropped out of college': \" Wait, so you dropped out of college and then you moved out of your, well, have we talked about that? I don't know. I don't know. We'll talk about college. Yeah. So I didn't want to go college. I don't care. You should. I'm not saying it's bad blah, blah, but for me, I hate, I hate school. I hate it. I hate it. I just want to make YouTube videos. It's all I ever want to do. That's all I ever wanted to do. But I didn't have the best grades in school. They didn't really have a job. I wasn't making enough after I graduated high school. So my mom was just like, either you go to college or you move out. Like you're not going to live here and not go to college or whatever. She wants what's best for me. She's not her being mean. It's like, obviously she didn't think this magical YouTube thing would work out. So she's like, you got to have some type of future. You can't just bet it all on the internet forever till you die. And yeah, so I just, I need to say the story in a way where it doesn't make my mom sound mean because she did it because she loves me. But so I go to college, just community college. It's not that expensive, whatever. And I just couldn't stand it, man. It made me just so depressed. I just, I hate it. I hate it. So I just want to be a YouTuber. That's it. And so after two weeks, literally just two weeks, I just stopped going. But I didn't have enough money to move out. That wasn't making anything. So I just didn't tell my mom. And I would act like it was going to college. And then I would just sit in my car in the college campus and just work on videos or edit or just work on a script or something and then I'd come home and I'd be like, hey, mom, college is great. And then I'd keep working and that can't last for that long. Yeah. No. Thankfully, I don't remember what happened. I remember sitting in like on the stairs in front of one of the college classrooms. I was like talking to James, one of the people you met and I was like, yo, I don't know what the fuck's going on, but like I've been just been grinding, grinding every hour of the day. And I just made like 20 grand a month. I was like, I'm ready to like tell mom that I'm failing every class and I move out tomorrow. He's like, okay. And I just I picture that because it's like 11 p.m. and I'm just pacing and then I'm like, yeah, mom, I'm I'm I have zeros and everything. I haven't been going. I was like, I'll move out tomorrow. And then I moved out the next day and she was so mad. But I was starting to finally make money. And so I could afford to move out. And there you go. How much longer after it was that your mom started working with you? Probably than a year after that. Yeah. And then I quickly got to the point where I was making her whole salary every month and it was like, why are you working? And people thought I was dumb. The first thing I did was retired my mom and people were like, why would you do that? You should see what he for yourself. And I was like, I love my mom. She's great. I'm actually the best mom of the planet. Like your mom's second. But yeah, I put her through a lot with poor grades, poor everything. Like, I mean, in a world where like, you know, I feel college and nothing comes out of this YouTube thing. It's just funny. I think what I could tell from meeting your mom was that your mom loves like the story of you becoming who you are today. She loves it so much. You know around all the other studios and offices and there's really like, there's no photos of you on the wall for the most part. There's no like pictures from videos, screenshots. There's a lot of play buttons. I'll say that. Sure, they're playing a clip of it. There's a lot of play buttons. But it wasn't until we went to the office where your mom works, where we walk in and it's like a Mr. Beast Mucino. And I was like, okay. So she's the one who's nostalgic about this entire journey. Yeah, because I met before I did that thing like two weeks into college. I was like, I was like trying to go shit with my mom. I was like, here's the deal. I'll go to college if you do all my homework. You do all the homework. No, I was like, I can't do this. I was like, I have to make videos. This makes me sad. This makes me happy. And she's like, this doesn't make money. This will make money. And I'm like, but this makes me happy. And she's like, no. And that's, I forgot that part. That's when I stopped going. My mom wouldn't agree to do all my homework. There's another funny story is, and I don't know why so early in the semester we had this, but we had to pair up with random people to do a project. And I had a partner and I just never came back. And I've completely forgot about it, but we were supposed to be working on something. And like, three months later, he messaged me. No, three months, all right, jump. Two weeks later, he was like, yo, we still doing this. And I was like, I'm never coming back to college. And he's like, so do I tell the professor? And then he messaged me like two months later. He was like, oh, yeah, they ended up going easy on me because my partner laughed. And he called me and told me about it. And it was like the writing bit in the class. We got a project together assigned and then I just never came back. And he just left with the whole thing and everyone else had a partner. You may have gotten him a better grade through sympathy. Exactly. That's what he said. And so I'm glad it worked out for him, but it was funny. I felt so bad. It's funny. Your mom told us that story too about how when you started making more than her paycheck every month, like that's when she was like, oh, wow. Which was a big deal for us. We didn't have any money. Yeah. Like again, I don't want to over-dramatisize it, but we really didn't have much. I was like, second I could. She didn't have to work twice on Wednesdays and maybe could take a little bit of time off. And she could actually breathe for the first time in her life and stuff like that. How did she see that? Where was that money coming from? From AdSense or from Brandeels or from everything? I don't know if I know at this point. I wasn't selling merch. Yeah. I mean, I was probably doing Brandeels for... No, I didn't even do my first Brand deal until I moved out. Because the 10K Brandeels, my first one, and that was when I was living at my new house. So that was after I dropped out. So yeah, I was probably doing like 20, 30 grand a month in Ad revenue. So whoever gave you that first 10K Brand deal got a lot of bank for their buck. I don't from Quid. Got it. Yeah. Which he works at current now and he's really smart. Oh, that's cool. He's still worked together to this day. It's funny. Oh, that's crazy. He does many other companies. Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah. Yeah, you've had a lot of long-term relationships with these companies. Because I'm not going anywhere. Yeah. I'm going to be here in 10 years. Yeah, that's interesting. Like with Honey and with Current. That's current. Now it sounds like it's even longer term without them. That's cool. Yeah, exactly. I mean, hiring Adam is cheat codes for your company because he just knows so many creators. And like, if he was to set some company that's doing like a million dollars a year in revenue or whatever, I'd still probably work with them just because I like the dude. You know what I mean? Yeah. Kind of funny. So this space now, this is now the official like biggest single investment you've made.\", \"MrBeast's $10 million studio\": \" Oh, of course. By 20 billion fold. See how it is. Because we like you guys are only seeing the inside of this space, but there's also a lot of space around it. Yeah. I don't even want to go to and depth. Sure. More acres than you could ever need. We're going to build 20,000 square feet of office. We're going to build a replica of this. I mean, the problem is like I talked about before. If you, you know, we have multiple warehouses, but if you, since the videos take months to do, and you know, and I want to upload it, and I do a world for a month. So any videos take 90 days to do, you know what I mean? That's 12 videos that in the next 90 days you got to do. And if you're not working on them now, then they won't happen in 90 days. And so it's the bottlenecks space, you know what I mean? Like I've told you guys this a million times, this is for you guys. If one video is taking up all of our studio, well, we have 11 other videos to work on, they can't happen till that. And so we just need tons of space to be able to work on videos months in advance because if we don't, they don't happen, you know what I mean? Do you think would be like a dream collaboration or a dream video to do out of here? Do you have something like that? Oh, a dream collaboration or dream video. Not dream, but dreaming. Yeah, like dream. No dream, dream. There you go. Yeah, I mean, if he did a face reveal, he would be like me get the cloud for that. But if he did like, and one of our videos, he just simple was mass. That would be, how are we having? Yeah. Just all of them. I pick whatever I want, the craft, the ultra viral video. It'd be like corpse and dream and all these people lined up. And it's just like the one after another, just take the mask off. Guaranteed 200 million views. I know when we were playing basketball last night, Sapnap was like, yeah, live with dream. I was like, oh, wow. So you've seen the base. Yeah, you want to sketch it out for us? Asking you or do I, is it doing on-ass? I don't know. What do I do? What color is the size? Yeah, that was funny. Yeah, that would be a very viral video. Yeah, that would be wild. Of course, obviously that would help. You just don't need all this space for that. That's true. Or maybe you do. Maybe you do it in a way where you do need it in space. My dream is uploading consistently, which that is a bigger thing. We're all like, some months, I don't even upload videos, some months, we upload four videos, some months, we upload one. It's just like, what does consistently mean for you? Is that once a week or is that? Or are you just saying anything? Right now I just want to upload once a week. But long term in the future, like three plus years from now, I'd love to get to the point where we're doing two original, giant, spectacles, never wore, seemed better than everyone else. Fucking huge, ginormous, best video in the **** in world videos twice a week. Do you think that any of your other videos, sorry, do you think any of the other channels will pass your main channel? No, no, no. You don't think so. I mean, even like four in language, even like India, like could India, the Hindi one. Could that pass the main one? Audience wise, more people could watch it, but I doubt it would pass the main, just because it's dubbed. It will get up there though, a large percentage. It's like, that's fun, you'll channel, and I'm sure you're showing it as we're doing this. It's getting two plus million views per video. And, you know what I mean? It's the same videos, it's dubbed, you know what I mean? So, which is that already as wild for dub content. Totally. But it's like this, it's actually a classic strategy in every other type of entertainment or whatever. Or a huge fan of anime. And like, I saw this one video of Naruto where they like compare a really emotional scene in like 10 different languages. And it's just fun. I mean, when I used to go to India when I was a kid, I would watch friends in Hindi, like, really? You know, it would sit there, yeah. Do you speak Hindi? I understand it fluently, I don't speak it. So, here are sentences in Hindi? Sure. Yeah. Come on. Yeah. And the must-see, up case, I know.\", 'Samir speaks hindi': \" Interesting. Okay. That means, hi, how are you doing? Tariq, you want to talk in Arabic? Let's do it all. What's that word you always say? Oh, baby. Oh, baby. Yeah. I'm a friend or a salamu alaikum alaikum, it's like, peace be upon you. It's calming just to hear people talking about it. It is. Yeah. I don't know why. They're watching to learn more about YouTube, they're taking notes. So, I'm just like, hey, Tariq, talk in Arabic. And they're like, okay, cameraman talks in Arabic. Comedian, cameraman speaks Arabic. Okay, we got the word though. It's interesting, like, if you don't know what someone else is saying, it's a different language, you can sort of like surrender the fact that you need to understand. Exactly. You need to pay attention to comprehend. You're just listening as I can. I kind of get that. You know? Yeah. I just get to enjoy that. Yeah, just sit there and lullaby. Yeah. But that's why visual storytelling is so important. It's just stuff that doesn't need language. That's like the stuff that I at least I've seen goes to most of our work. And I know we've been going on for a while, but now it is the time to hit us the most important question because you're re-hoking the viewers. You're telling them this video is not over. What's the big question to keep them watching? Last time you were on our channel, you told everyone that if they subscribed, you would pick one of them and give away $1,000. Or actually. No, you guys would get out. You're telling that we would give away $1,000? Did you do it? Yeah, we did it. We did it. We did it. No, no, we didn't. We filmed it, too. Yes.\", 'Giveaway': \" My question now for you is, if people are watching this video and they subscribe, how much money do they... They get? If either we give it or you give it. How much money do we give? Okay. How about this? If you subscribe, not you, but one random person that does, I'll give you a few questions. I'll give you this Gatorade bottle. I'm going to give it to you. Okay. And they'll give you $500. Okay. Deal. You can get this... Unopened. Actually not open. Let me make it less valuable for you. Okay. Here, we'll just drink a sip. Clip this. Sell this on eBay with this clip. Someone pay $500 for this. We are literally going to take this. So if you subscribe to the channel, you can win this and you can win a $500. There you go. We'll pick one random person. All you have to do is hit that subscribe button. It's closing in on a million subscribers. The second they just start getting 70% retention on a video. We're closing in the second they do the things I tell them to do. Yeah. All right. I can't wait to find out who gets this. Whoever gets it, don't drink it. Damn it. Watch this. It's like NFT. Yeah. That's going to get NFT. Cool. Okay. Cool. I'm happy with it. That was awesome. Yeah. That means we should abruptly in it.\"}]\n"
